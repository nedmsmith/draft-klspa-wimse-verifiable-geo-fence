--- abstract

Financial services, healthcare and government entities have data residency requirements that aim to protect sensitive data by specifying its location.
Data location can be both geographic and host-centric.
Geo-location affinity means workloads are cryptographically bound to a geographic boundary.
Host affinity means workloads are cryptographically bound to a specific execution environment.
WIMSE architecture can be improved to show how location can be cryptographically bound to WIMSE identities.
This document augments WIMSE architecture to include geo-location and host affinity use cases and workflows.

# Introduction

This document describes a framework for trustworthy and verifiable geo-fencing of workloads.
It details use cases, architectural flows, and protocol enhancements that leverage trusted hardware (e.g., TPM), attestation protocols, and geo-location services.
The goal is to enable interoperable, cryptographically verifiable claims about workload residency and location, supporting compliance, security, and operational requirements in multi-system environments.

As organizations increasingly adopt cloud and distributed computing, the need to enforce data residency, geo-location affinity, and host affinity has become critical for regulatory compliance and risk management.
Traditional approaches to geographic and host enforcement rely on trust in infrastructure providers or network-based controls, which are insufficient in adversarial or multi-tenant environments.

Recent advances in trusted computing, remote attestation, and workload identity standards enable a new class of solutions where the geographic location and host integrity of workloads can be cryptographically attested and verified.
By binding workload identity to both platform and domain attributes, such as TPM-backed device identity and verifiable geographic boundaries, organizations can enforce fine-grained policies to define where and how sensitive workloads are executed.

Data residency requirements are described in more detail in [tcg-geo-loc].

An example of platform identity binding (i.e., host affinity) is described in [tcg-tpm].

# Conventions and Definitions

# Use Cases

Data residency use cases can be divided into three categories, (1) server-centric location, (2) user-centric location, and (3) regulatority compliance.

## **Category 1**: Server-centric Location

Enterprises (e.g., healthcare, banking) need cryptographic proof of trustworthy geographic boundary (i.e., region, zone, countries, state etc.) for cloud facing workloads.

* **Server workload <-> Server workload - General**:
Enterprises handling of sensitive data relies on dedicated cloud hosts (e.g., EU sovereign cloud providers) that ensure compmliance to data residency laws, while also ensuring appropriate levels of service (e.g., high availability).
To meet data residency legal requirements, enterprises need to verify workload data is processed by hosts that are within a geographic boundary and workload data is only transmitted between specified geographic boundaries.

* **Server workload <-> Server workload - Agentic AI**:
Enterprises need to ensure that the AI agent is located in a specific geographic boundary when downloading sensitive data or performing other sensitive operations. A secure AI agent, running on a trusted host with TPM-backed attestation, interacts with geo-location and geo-fencing services to obtain verifiable proof of its geographic boundary. The agent periodically collects location data from trusted sensors, obtains attested composite location from a geo-location service, and enforces geo-fence policies via a geo-fencing service. The resulting attested geo-fence proof is used to bind workload identity to both the host and its geographic location, enabling secure, policy-driven execution of AI workloads and compliance with data residency requirements.

{: #fig-secure-agentic-ai artwork-align="center" title="Cybersecure and Compliant Agentic AI Workflow"}

* **User workload <-> Server workload**:
Enterprises ensure that it is communicating with a server (e.g., cloud services) located within a specific geographic boundary.

## **Category 2**: User-centric Location

Enterprises need cryptographic proof of trustworthy geographic boundary for user facing workloads.

* A server (or proxy) authenticates to clients using different TLS certificates, each signed by a different Certificate Authority (CA), based on the geographic boundaries of user workloads.

* Enterprise Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) provides on-premise computing that is a basis for defining geo-location boundaries.
A telco network provides a means for communication between premises.

* Construction & Engineering of SaaS workloads can benefit from attested geographic boundary data from end-user devices to restrict access within specific geo-political regions (e.g., California).
Enabling per-user or group-level geo-fencing helps prevent fraudulent access originating outside the authorized area.

* Healthcare providers need to ensure that the Host is located in a specific geographic boundary when downloading patient data or performing other sensitive operations.

* U.S. Presidential Executive Order (doj-cisa) compliance directs Cloud Service Provider (CSP) support personnel be located in restricted geographies  (e.g., Venezuela, Iran, China, North Korea).
However, those personnel should not be allowed to support U.S. customers.
Geo-location enforcement can ensure policy compliance. See [doj-cisa].

## **Category 3**: Regulatory Compliance
Geographic boundary attestation helps satisfy data residency and data sovereignty requirements for regulatory compliance.

## Data Residency Requirements

Data residency use cases motivate the following requirements:

* Location-specific verifiable claims.
* Standards-based attestation of geographic location claims.
* Interoperable policy enforcement for audit and compliance.
* Security guarantees that are portable across diverse deployment topologies.

# Approach Summary
Host contains location devices like mobile sensor, GPS sensor, WiFi sensor, GNSS sensor, etc. Host is a compute node, including servers, routers, and end-user appliances like smartphones or tablets or PCs.
Host has a discrete TPM. Note on TPM -- The EK certificate is a digital certificate signed by the TPM manufacturer's CA which verifies the identity and trustworthiness of the TPM's Endorsement Key (EK);  TPM attestation key (AK) is cryptographically backed by TPM EK.
For the initial version of the draft, host is bare metal Linux OS host and interactions are with TPM.

Trusted hosts are the hosts which have trustworthy device composition (TPM EK, Mobile-SIM, GPS device id etc.), endorsed by manufacturer/owner, and use a trustworthy OS.
A set of trusted hosts along with the device composition details and OS details are recorded in a shared datastore (database or ledger) by the host owner.

Workload and Agent run on a set of trusted hosts. Workload can be a server app, a mobile/PC app (including browser), or a network host (e.g., router).
Proof of Residency of workload on a trusted host is obtained using TPM. Workload asks its Agent for proof, which in turn asks TPM for AK-attested proof.

Agent sends attested geographic boundary (e.g., cloud region, city, country etc.) and Workload’s parameters to Workload Identity Manager (WIM).

* Example for Agent used in this document: SPIFFE/SPIRE agent (spire) can be enhanced to add attested geographic boundary that will become part of Identity granted (e.g., SVID).

* Example for WIM used in this document: SPIFFE/Spire server

* WIM gives signed Workload ID (WID) with geographic boundary as an additional field.
This could be a certificate or a token.

# Attestation for System Bootstrap and Agent Initialization
This section describes workload attestation based on SPIFFE/SPIRE.

**Figure 1: Modified SPIFFE/SPIRE architecture with new geo-location plugin**
{: #fig-modified-spiffe-spire artwork-align="center" title="Modified SPIFFE/SPIRE architecture with new geo-location plugin"}

In the context of the SPIFFE/SPIRE architecture (spire), the SPIFFE/SPIRE agent includes a new geo-location plugin -- this is depicted in the figure below. The agent is a daemon running on bare-metal Linux OS Host (H) as a process with direct access to TPM (root permissions for TPM 2.0 access may be needed for certain Linux distributions for certain H hardware configurations).
The agent, using the geo-location plugin, can gather the location from host local location sensors (e.g. GPS, GNSS).
The agent has a TPM plugin (spire-tpm) which interacts with the TPM.
The server (SPIFFE/SPIRE server) is running in cluster which is isolated from the cluster in which the agent is running.

## Attestation of OS Integrity and Proof of Residency on Host
As part of system boot/reboot process, boot loader based measured system boot with remote SPIFFE/SPIRE server verification is used to ensure only approved OS is running on an approved hardware platform.

Measurement Collection: During the boot process, the boot loader collects measurements (hashes) of the boot components and configurations.
The boot components are Firmware/BIOS/UEFI, bootloader, OS, drivers, location devices and initial programs.
All the location devices (e.g. GPS sensor, Mobile sensor) version/firmware in a platform are measured during each boot -- this is a boot loader enhancement.
Any new location device which is hotswapped in will be evaluated for inclusion only during next reboot.

Log Creation: These measurements are recorded in a log, often referred to as the TCGLog, and stored in the TPM's Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).

Attestation Report: The TPM generates an attestation report, which includes the signed measurements and the boot configuration log.
The signature of the attestation report (aka quote) is by a TPM attestation key (AK).
This attestation includes data about the TPM's state and can be used to verify that the AK is indeed cryptographically backed by the TPM EK certificate.

Transmission: The attestation report is then sent to an external verifier (server), through a secure TLS connection.

Remote Verification: The remote server checks the integrity of the attestation report and validates the measurements against known good values from the set of trusted hosts in the shared datastore.
The server also validates that the TPM EK certificate has not been revoked and part of approved list of TPM EK identifiers associated with hardware platform.
At this point, we can be sure that the hardware platform is approved for running workloads and is running an approved OS.

## Start/restart time attestation/remote verification of agent for integrity and proof of residency on Host
As part of agent start/restart process, linux integrity measurement architecture (linux-ima) is used to ensure that only approved executable for agent is loaded.

Measurement collection: The agent executable is measured by linux-ima before it is loaded.
Local Verification: Enforce local validation of a measurement against a approved value stored in an extended attribute of the file.

TPM attestation and remote server verification:

* Agent generates attestation key (AK) using TPM for proof of residency on H.

* Agent sends the AK attestation parameters (PCR quote, workload attestation public etc.) and EK certificate to the server

* Server inspects EK certificate. If ca_path exists, and the EK certificate was signed by any chain in ca_path, validation passes

* If validation passed, the server generates a credential activation challenge. The challenge's secret is encrypted using the EK public key.

* Server sends challenge to agent

* Agent decrypts the challenge's secret

* Agent sends back decrypted secret

* Server verifies that the decrypted secret is the same it used to build the challenge

* Server creates a SPIFFE ID along with the sha256sum of the TPM AK public key.
Server stores agent SPIFFE ID mapping to TPM AK public key in a shared datastore.

# Agent geo-location and geo-fencing workflow

- this is run periodically (say every 5 minutes) to ensure that the Host is in the same location

## Step 1: Agent gets attested composite location using Geo-location service (GL)
Geo-location service (GL) runs outside of Host -- besides the location from device location sources (e.g. GPS, GNSS), it will connect to mobile location service providers (e.g., Telefonica) using GSMA location API (gsma-loc).

* Agent gathers the location from Host local location sensors (e.g. GPS, GNSS).
Agent connects to GL using secure connection mechanism like TLS. Agent provides the gathered location to GL over the secure connection.

* Location has a quality associated with it. For example, IP address-based location is of lower quality as compared to other sources.

* GL ensures that the device composition of Host (reference to Host composition table for further details) is intact (e.g. SIM card not plugged out of Host) by periodically polling the state of Host.
Host is a member of the set of trusted Hosts in the shared datastore -- the shared datastore has the Host composition details.
Note that e-SIM does not have the plugging out problem like standard SIM but could be subject to e-SIM swap attack.
Host composition (HC) comprises of TPM EK, Mobile-SIM etc.

* GL derives a combined location, including location quality, from various location sensors for a Host with multiple location sensors -- this includes the gathered location from Agent running on Host.
As an example, GPS is considered less trustworthy as compared to mobile.

* The composite location comprises of combined geo-location (which includes location quality), Host composition (TPM EK, mobile-SIM etc.) and time from a trusted source.
GL signs the composite location with a private key whose public key certificate is a public trusted transparent ledger such as certificate transparency log.
Now we have a attested composite location.

* Agent is returned the attested composite location over the secure connection.
Agent signs the attested composite location using TPM AK establishing proof of residency of composite location to Host. This is called attested proof-of-residency aware composite location (APL).

## Step 2: Agent gets attested geographic boundary using Geo-fencing (GF) service

* Geo-fence policies are of four flavours - (1) boolean membership of given boundary (rectangular, circular, state etc.), (2) precise location, (3) precise bounding box/circle of location, (4) approximate location with no definition of boundary.
The first one, boolean membership of given boundary, is the most common and will be assumed as the default.
They are available in the form of pre-defined templates or can be configured on demand.
Enterprises, who are the user of the Hosts, choose the geo-fence policies to be enforced for various Hosts.
Note that the Hosts must belong to the set of trusted Hosts in a shared ledger.
The geo-fence policies applied to the set of trusted Hosts are recorded in a shared ledger.

* Location agent on Host supplies (APL) to geo-fence service (GF) over a secure connection.
GF performs geo-fence policy enforcement by matching the location against configured geo-fence policies. GF signs the geo-fence policy match result, along with a trusted time (potentially leverage RFC 3161), with a private key whose public key certificate is a public trusted transparent ledger such as certificate transparency log.

* Geo-fence policy match result details (non-exhaustive): 1) Geo-fence policy which matched 2) Boolean - inside or outside geo-fence - applicable to boolean membership of given boundary policy type.

* Agent is returned the attested geo-fence policy match result. Agent signs the attested geo-fence policy match result using TPM AK establishing proof of residency of geo-fence policy match result to Host. This is called attested proof-of-residency aware geo-fence policy match result (APGL).

# Workload (W) attestation and remote verification - key steps

* Agent ensures that Workload connects to it on Host local socket (e.g. Unix domain socket).
Agent generates private/public key pair for Workload. Agent signs the Workload public key with its TPM AK.
Agent sends the signed Workload public key along with its SPIFFE ID and last known APGL to the server.
Note that the TPM AK is already verified by the server as part of the agent attestation process establishing proof of residency of Agent to Host.

* Server gets the Agent TPM AK public key from the SPIFFE ID by looking it up in the shared datastore.
Server verifies the Workload public key signature using the TPM AK public key.
Server then sends an encrypted challenge to the agent.
The challenge's secret is encrypted using the Workload public key.

* Agent decrypts the challenge using its Workload private key and sends the response back to the server.

* Server verifies that the decrypted secret is the same it used to build the challenge.
It then issues SPIFFE ID for Workload. The SPIFFE ID is signed by the server and contains the Workload public key and the geographic boundary (e.g. cloud region, city, country etc.) of the Host.
The geographic boundary is obtained from the last known APGL. The server also stores the Workload SPIFFE ID mapping to Workload public key in a shared datastore.

# Networking Protocol Changes
Workload ID (WID), with location field, in the form of a proof-of-residency certificate or token needs to be conveyed to the peer during connection establishment. The connection is end-to-end across proxies like

## Using TLS

* HTTP session termination (SASE firewall, API gateways etc.) - terminate and re-establish TLS.

* RDP latest version - terminate and re-establish TLS; tcp/ip.

* SCTP session termination (Mobile network SASE firewall etc.) - terminate and re-establish TLS; sctp/ip; does not use TCP or UDP.

* NFS - terminate and re-establish TLS; tcp/ip.

## Not Using TLS

* SSH tunnel (Jump Hosts etc.) - terminate and re-establish ssh; tcp/ip; does not use TLS.

* IPSEC tunnel (Router control plane etc.) - terminates IPSEC tunnel and forwards encapsulated traffic; ip; does not use TLS.

## Approaches

* Enhance applications (e.g. MCP protocol) to convey Workload ID (WID), with location field.

* Enhance HTTP headers to convey Workload ID (WID), with location field.

* Enhance TLS to convey Workload ID (WID), with location field.

* Enhance SSH/IPSEC to convey Workload ID (WID), with location field.

# Host Composition Table

| Component  | Functionality       | Comments |
|---
| Host | The system that is composed of all of the following software or hardware components. | |
| Trusted hardware devices (focus on geo-location) | Storage root of trust: * TPM - Location root of trust options: GPS sensor, GNSS sensor - signal authentication  prevents spoofing [galileo], Mobile sensor - modem, antenna, SIM - Mobile device location is obtained from mobile network operator and not from device, Wi-Fi sensor - modem, antenna | |
| Boot loader | All the devices (version/firmware) in a platform are trusted and measured during each boot (boot loader enhancement), Any new device (e.g. Mobile location sensor) which is hotswapped in will be evaluated for inclusion only during next reboot. | |
| Trusted OS | Trusted drivers for storage/location root of trust. Does not tamper GPS location/Wi-Fi data. ||
| Geo-location Agent SW - OS level service | Trusted application. Does not tamper GPS location/Wi-Fi data. Sign GPS location data (latitude/ longitude/ altitude), proximal Wi-Fi access points using TPM attestation key. | Possibly a Spire-agent plug-in with TPM attestation. |

**Note**: A GPS sensor with a cryptographic signature, also known as GNSS signal authentication, uses digital signatures in the broadcast signal to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the GPS data, protecting against spoofing attacks.

# Authorization Policy Implementers

Policy Implementers use attested a geographic boundary from W to make decisions.
Example implementers:

* SaaS application.

* K8s node agent.

* OS process scheduler.

If the policy implementer is at the SaaS application level, things are simpler.
However, if it is pushed down to, say, K8s or OS process scheduler or JVM class loader/deserializer, then malware can be prevented (similar to code-signed application).

# Security Considerations

The proposed framework introduces several security considerations that must be addressed to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of geo-fencing:

- **TPM and Hardware Trust**: The security of the solution depends on the integrity of the TPM and other hardware roots of trust. Physical attacks, firmware vulnerabilities, or supply chain compromises could undermine attestation. Regular updates, secure provisioning, and monitoring are required.

- **Geo-location Spoofing**: Location sensors (e.g., GPS) are susceptible to spoofing or replay attacks. Use of cryptographically authenticated signals (e.g., Galileo GNSS, Mobile network) and cross-verification with multiple sources can mitigate this risk.

- **SIM and e-SIM Attacks**: Physical SIM removal or e-SIM swap attacks can break the binding between device and location. Continuous monitoring of device composition and periodic re-attestation are recommended.

- **Software Integrity**: The geo-location agent and supporting software must be protected against tampering. Use of Linux IMA, secure boot, and measured launch environments helps ensure only approved software is executed.

- **Communication Security**: All attestation and geo-location data must be transmitted over secure, authenticated channels (e.g., TLS) to prevent interception or manipulation.

- **Policy Enforcement**: The enforcement of geo-fence policies must be robust against attempts by malicious workloads or agents to bypass controls. Policy decisions should be based on verifiable, signed attestation evidence.

- **Time Source Integrity**: Trusted time sources are necessary to prevent replay attacks and ensure the freshness of attestation data.

- **Datastore Security**: The shared datastore containing trusted host compositions and geo-fence policies must be protected against unauthorized access and tampering, using encryption and access controls.

By addressing these considerations, the framework aims to provide a secure and reliable foundation for verifiable geo-fencing in diverse deployment environments.
