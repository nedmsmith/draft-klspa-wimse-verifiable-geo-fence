# Use Cases: Cryptographic Attestation of Geographic Boundaries
Standardizing the attestation of a host’s geographic location enables interoperable enforcement of policy, compliance, and security guarantees across diverse deployment environments.
The following use cases motivate the need for a verifiable geographic claim.

## **Category 1**: Enterprise need cryptographic proof of trustworthy geographic boundary (region, zone, countries, state etc.) for cloud facing workloads
* **Server workload <-> Server workload**:

Enterprises handling sensitive data—such as EU banks—rely on dedicated cloud hosts (e.g., EU sovereign cloud providers) to ensure high availability while complying with data residency laws.
To meet these requirements, they need to be able to verify the geographic boundary where their dedicated hosts are deployed.

* **User workload <-> Server workload**:

(e.g. healthcare enterprise) ensuring that  it is communicating with a server (e.g. cloud service) located within a specific geographic boundary.

## **Category 2**: Enterprise need cryptographic proof of trustworthy geographic boundary for user facing workloads

* A server (or proxy) authenticates to clients using different TLS certificates, each signed by a different Certificate Authority (CA), based on the geographic boundaries of user workloads.

* Enterprise on-premise Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) provides its geographic boundary using a mobile network. This ensures that the Host (H) – a computing device such as a PC, phone, or router – connected to the CPE, is physically present on-premise.

* Construction & Engineering SaaS workloads can benefit immensely from attested geographic boundary data from end-user devices to restrict access within specific regions (e.g., California). Enabling per-user or group-level geo-fencing helps prevent fraudulent access originating outside the authorized area.

* Healthcare providers need to ensure that the Host (H) is located in a specific geographic boundary (countries e.g. US) when downloading patient data or performing other sensitive operations.

* U.S. Presidential Executive Order compliance: For example, U.S. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) may have support personnel located in a restricted geographic boundary (countries e.g., Venezuela, Iran, China, North Korea). However, those personnel should not be allowed to support U.S. customers. Geo-location enforcement can ensure policy compliance. See [alert].

## **Category 3**: Security assurance and compliance

Geographic boundary attestation helps satisfy data residency and data sovereignty requirements for regulatory compliance.

# High-level Approach

## Step 1

Host (H) contains location Devices (HD) like mobile sensor, GPS sensor, WiFi sensor, GNSS sensor, etc. H is a compute node, including servers, routers, and end-user appliances like smartphones or tablets or PCs.

## Step 2

Location agent on H gets its attested location (L), and signed by, geo-location service (GL). Signed location delivered as a certificate or signed token (e.g., JWT)? Proof of Residency of location agent on H is obtained using vTPM. Location agent asks vTPM for AIK-attested proof.

### GL can run inside H or outside of H:

* Inside H: Only GPS/GNSS device location sources are available or would like to maximize location privacy.

* Outside H: In turn will connect to mobile location service providers (e.g., Telefonica), and use other sources such as WiFi-based location service providers (e.g., Google) or device location sources (e.g., GNSS).

### Location Quality

* Location (L) has a quality associated with it.
For example, IP address-based L is of lower quality as compared to other sources.

### Definition of attested location generated by GL

* GL ensures that the composition of H is intact (e.g. SIM card not plugged out from CPE) by periodically polling the state of H. Note that e-SIM does not have the plugging out problem like standard SIM.

* GL derives a composite location, including location quality, from various location sensors for a H with multiple location sensors.

* GL signs the composite location, along with a trusted time, with a private key whose public key certificate is a public trusted transparent ledger such as certificate transparency log.

### Geo-location Service

* Geo-location service should check allowed hosts in a shared ledger (TPM EK, mobile-SIM).

* Note that the location is a property of H. Other entities on H (e.g., an application) will have to associate with L through proof of residency on H.

## Step 3

Geo-fence policies are of various types (rectangular, circular etc.).
They are available in the form of pre-defined templates or can be configured on demand.
Enterprises choose the geo-fence policies to be enforced for various hosts. Note that the hosts must belong to the list of allowed hosts in a shared ledger (TPM EK, mobile-SIM).
The geo-fence policies applied to various hosts are recorded in a shared ledger.

## Step 4

Location agent on H supplies attested location (L) to geo-fence service (GF) which performs geo-fence policy enforcement by matching the location against configured geo-fence policies (available in a shared ledger) and returns an attested geo-fence policy match result.

### Geo-fence policy engine is part of GF and uses L and quality of L to make decisions

Geo-fence policy engine can be coded anywhere, including H such as a mobile app for maximizing privacy, a workload/server app, an workload orchestrator, an OS process scheduler, a JVM deserializer, or a storage server.

### Definition of attested geo-fence policy match result (GFL)

Geo-fence policy match result details:

* Geo-fence policy hash which matched

* Boolean (inside or outside geo-fence)

* Distance from geo-fence

GF signs the geo-fence policy match result, along with a trusted time, with a private key whose public key certificate is a public trusted transparent ledger such as certificate transparency log.

GF logs geo-fence policy match result in a shared ledger.

### Log result in ledger - todo

## Step 5

Workload (W) and Workload Agent run on H.
W can be a server app, a mobile/PC app (including browser), or a network host (e.g., router).

## Step 6

Between W and H, there may be several layers of software (e.g., baremetal, hypervisors, VMs, containers, etc.).
Our focus is on W and a virtual-TPM (vTPM) accessible to W, with vTPM transitively and securely linked to bare metal TPM.

If W is directly on bare metal H, the vTPM = TPM on baremetal.

## Step 7

Proof of Residency of W on H is obtained using vTPM. W asks its Workload Agent for proof, which in turn asks vTPM for AIK-attested proof.
(Note: TPM-EK authenticity checked in ledger by Geo-fencing service earlier, as described above.)

W’s Proof of Residency on H + H’s attested location from geo-fencing service = attested location for W

## Step 8

Workload Agent sends attested location + W’s parameters to Workload Identity Manager (WIM).

* Example for a Workload Agent: SPIFFE/Spire agent can be enhanced to add attested location that will become part of Identity granted (e.g., SVID).

* Example for WIM: SPIFFE/Spire server

## Step 9

Workload Identity Manager gives signed Workload ID (WID) with location as a field or location-matches boolean result as a field.
This could be a certificate or a token.

# Networking Protocol Changes

Workload ID (WID), with location field, in the form of a proof-of-residency certificate or token needs to be conveyed to the peer during connection established. The connection is end-to-end across proxies like

## Using TLS

* HTTP session termination (SASE firewall, API gateways etc.) - terminate and re-establish TLS.

* RDP latest version - terminate and re-establish TLS; tcp/ip.

* SCTP session termination (Mobile network SASE firewall etc.) - terminate and re-establish TLS; sctp/ip; does not use TCP or UDP.

## Not Using TLS

* SSH tunnel (Jump hosts etc.) - terminate and re-establish ssh; tcp/ip; does not use TLS.

* IPSEC tunnel (Router control plane etc.) - terminates IPSEC tunnel and forwards encapsulated traffic; ip; does not use TLS.

## Approaches

* Enhance applications (e.g. MCP protocol) to convey Workload ID (WID), with location field.

* Enhance HTTP headers to convey Workload ID (WID), with location field.

* Enhance TLS to convey Workload ID (WID), with location field.

* Enhance SSH/IPSEC to convey Workload ID (WID), with location field.

# Host Details

| Component  | Functionality       | Comments |
|---
| Host | The system that is composed of all of the following software or hardware components. | |
| Trusted hardware devices (focus on geo-location) | Storage root of trust: * TPM - Location root of trust options: GPS sensor, GNSS sensor - signal authentication  prevents spoofing [galileo], Mobile sensor - modem, antenna, SIM - Mobile device location is obtained from mobile network operator and not from device, Wi-Fi sensor - modem, antenna | |
| Boot loader | All the devices (version/firmware) in a platform are trusted and measured during each boot (boot loader enhancement), Any new device (e.g. Mobile location sensor) which is hotswapped in will be evaluated for inclusion only during next reboot. | |
| Trusted OS | Trusted drivers for storage/location root of trust. Does not tamper GPS location/Wi-Fi data. ||
| Geo-location Agent SW - OS level service | Trusted application. Does not tamper GPS location/Wi-Fi data. Sign GPS location data (latitude/ longitude/ altitude), proximal Wi-Fi access points using TPM attestation key. | Possibly a Spire-agent plug-in with TPM attestation. |

**Note**: A GPS sensor with a cryptographic signature, also known as GNSS signal authentication, uses digital signatures in the broadcast signal to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the GPS data, protecting against spoofing attacks.

# Authorization Policy Implementers

Policy Implementers use attested a geographic boundary from W to make decisions.
Example implementers:

* SaaS application.

* K8s node agent.

* OS process scheduler.

If the policy implementer is at the SaaS application level, things are simpler.
However, if it is pushed down to, say, K8s or OS process scheduler or JVM class loader/deserializer, then malware can be prevented (similar to code-signed application).
