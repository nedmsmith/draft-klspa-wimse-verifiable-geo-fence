          Trustworthy and Verifiable Geo-fencing for Workloads
             draft-lkspa-wimse-verifiable-geo-fence-latest

Abstract

   Financial services, healthcare and government entities have data
   residency requirements that aim to protect sensitive data by
   specifying its location.  Data location can be both geographic and
   host-centric.  Geo-location affinity means workloads are
   cryptographically bound to a geographic boundary.  Host affinity
   means workloads are cryptographically bound to a specific execution
   environment.  WIMSE architecture can be improved to show how location
   can be cryptographically bound to WIMSE identities.  This document
   augments WIMSE architecture to include geo-location and host affinity
   use cases and workflows.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a framework for trustworthy and verifiable
   geo-fencing of workloads.  It details use cases, architectural flows,
   and protocol enhancements that leverage trusted hardware (e.g., TPM),
   attestation protocols, and geo-location services.  The goal is to
   enable interoperable, cryptographically verifiable claims about
   workload residency and location, supporting compliance, security, and
   operational requirements in multi-system environments.

   As organizations increasingly adopt cloud and distributed computing,
   the need to enforce data residency, geo-location affinity, and host
   affinity has become critical for regulatory compliance and risk
   management.  Traditional approaches to geographic and host
   enforcement rely on trust in infrastructure providers or network-
   based controls, which are insufficient in adversarial or multi-tenant
   environments.

   Recent advances in trusted computing, remote attestation, and
   workload identity standards enable a new class of solutions where the
   geographic location and host integrity of workloads can be
   cryptographically attested and verified.  By binding workload
   identity to both platform and domain attributes, such as TPM-backed
   device identity and verifiable geographic boundaries, organizations
   can enforce fine-grained policies to define where and how sensitive
   workloads are executed.

   Data residency requirements are described in more detail in
   [tcg-geo-loc].

   An example of platform identity binding (i.e., host affinity) is
   described in [tcg-tpm].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use Cases

   Data residency use cases can be divided into three categories, (1)
   server-centric location, (2) user-centric location, and (3)
   regulatority compliance.

3.1.  *Category 1*: Server-centric Location

   Enterprises (e.g., healthcare, banking) need cryptographic proof of
   trustworthy geographic boundary (i.e., region, zone, countries, state
   etc.) for cloud facing workloads.

   *  *Server workload <-> Server workload*: Enterprises handling of
      sensitive data relies on dedicated cloud hosts (e.g., EU sovereign
      cloud providers) that ensure compmliance to data residency laws,
      while also ensuring appropriate levels of service (e.g., high
      availability).  To meet data residency legal requirements,
      enterprises need to verify workload data is processed by hosts
      that are within a geographic boundary and workload data is only
      transmitted between specified geographic boundaries.

   *  *User workload <-> Server workload*: Enterprises ensure that it is
      communicating with a server (e.g., cloud services) located within
      a specific geographic boundary.

3.2.  *Category 2*: User-centric Location

   Enterprises need cryptographic proof of trustworthy geographic
   boundary for user facing workloads.

   *  A server (or proxy) authenticates to clients using different TLS
      certificates, each signed by a different Certificate Authority
      (CA), based on the geographic boundaries of user workloads.

   *  Enterprise Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) provides on-premise
      computing that is a basis for defining geo-location boundaries.  A
      telco network provides a means for communication between premises.

   *  Construction & Engineering of SaaS workloads can benefit from
      attested geographic boundary data from end-user devices to
      restrict access within specific geo-political regions (e.g.,
      California).  Enabling per-user or group-level geo-fencing helps
      prevent fraudulent access originating outside the authorized area.

   *  Healthcare providers need to ensure that the Host (H) is located
      in a specific geographic boundary when downloading patient data or
      performing other sensitive operations.

   *  U.S.  Presidential Executive Order (doj-cisa) compliance directs
      Cloud Service Provider (CSP) support personnel be located in
      restricted geographies (e.g., Venezuela, Iran, China, North
      Korea).  However, those personnel should not be allowed to support
      U.S. customers.  Geo-location enforcement can ensure policy
      compliance.  See [doj-cisa].

3.3.  *Category 3*: Regulatory Compliance

   Geographic boundary attestation helps satisfy data residency and data
   sovereignty requirements for regulatory compliance.

3.4.  Data Residency Requirements

   Data residency use cases motivate the following requirements:

   *  Location-specific verifiable claims.

   *  Standards-based attestation of geographic location claims.

   *  Interoperable policy enforcement for audit and compliance.

   *  Security guarantees that are portable across diverse deployment
      topologies.

4.  Approach Summary

   Host contains location devices like mobile sensor, GPS sensor, WiFi
   sensor, GNSS sensor, etc.  Host is a compute node, including servers,
   routers, and end-user appliances like smartphones or tablets or PCs.
   Host has a discrete TPM.  Note on TPM -- The EK certificate is a
   digital certificate signed by the TPM manufacturer's CA which
   verifies the identity and trustworthiness of the TPM's Endorsement
   Key (EK); TPM attestation key (AK) is cryptographically backed by TPM
   EK.  For the initial version of the draft, host is bare metal Linux
   OS host and interactions are with TPM.

   Trusted hosts are the hosts which have trustworthy device composition
   (TPM EK, Mobile-SIM, GPS device id etc.), endorsed by manufacturer/
   owner, and use a trustworthy OS.  A set of trusted hosts along with
   the device composition details and OS details are recorded in a
   shared datastore (database or ledger) by the host owner.

   Workload (W) and Agent run on a set of trusted hosts.  W can be a
   server app, a mobile/PC app (including browser), or a network host
   (e.g., router).  Proof of Residency of W on a trusted host is
   obtained using TPM.  W asks its Agent for proof, which in turn asks
   TPM for AK-attested proof.

   Agent sends attested geographic boundary (e.g., cloud region, city,
   country etc.) and W’s parameters to Workload Identity Manager (WIM).

   *  Example for Agent used in this document: SPIFFE/SPIRE agent
      (spire) can be enhanced to add attested geographic boundary that
      will become part of Identity granted (e.g., SVID).

   *  Example for WIM used in this document: SPIFFE/Spire server

   *  WIM gives signed Workload ID (WID) with geographic boundary as an
      additional field.  This could be a certificate or a token.

5.  Attestation for System Bootstrap and Agent Initialization

   This section describes workload attestation based on SPIFFE/SPIRE.

   SPIFFE/SPIRE architecture with new geo-location plugin

   In the context of the SPIFFE/SPIRE architecture (spire), the SPIFFE/
   SPIRE agent includes a new geo-location plugin -- this is depicted in
   the figure below.  The agent is a daemon running on bare-metal Linux
   OS Host (H) as a process with direct access to TPM (root permissions
   for TPM 2.0 access may be needed for certain Linux distributions for
   certain H hardware configurations).  The agent, using the geo-
   location plugin, can gather the location from host local location
   sensors (e.g. GPS, GNSS).  The agent has a TPM plugin (spire-tpm)
   which interacts with the TPM.  The server (SPIFFE/SPIRE server) is
   running in cluster which is isolated from the cluster in which the
   agent is running.

5.1.  Attestation of OS Integrity and Proof of Residency on Host

   As part of system boot/reboot process, boot loader based measured
   system boot with remote SPIFFE/SPIRE server verification is used to
   ensure only approved OS is running on an approved hardware platform.

   Measurement Collection: During the boot process, the boot loader
   collects measurements (hashes) of the boot components and
   configurations.  The boot components are Firmware/BIOS/UEFI,
   bootloader, OS, drivers, location devices and initial programs.  All
   the location devices (e.g. GPS sensor, Mobile sensor) version/
   firmware in a platform are measured during each boot -- this is a
   boot loader enhancement.  Any new location device which is hotswapped
   in will be evaluated for inclusion only during next reboot.

   Log Creation: These measurements are recorded in a log, often
   referred to as the TCGLog, and stored in the TPM's Platform
   Configuration Registers (PCRs).

   Attestation Report: The TPM generates an attestation report, which
   includes the signed measurements and the boot configuration log.  The
   signature of the attestation report (aka quote) is by a TPM
   attestation key (AK).  This attestation includes data about the TPM's
   state and can be used to verify that the AK is indeed
   cryptographically backed by the TPM EK certificate.

   Transmission: The attestation report is then sent to an external
   verifier (server), through a secure TLS connection.

   Remote Verification: The remote server checks the integrity of the
   attestation report and validates the measurements against known good
   values from the set of trusted hosts in the shared datastore.  The
   server also validates that the TPM EK certificate has not been
   revoked and part of approved list of TPM EK identifiers associated
   with hardware platform.  At this point, we can be sure that the
   hardware platform is approved for running workloads and is running an
   approved OS.

5.2.  Start/restart time attestation/remote verification of agent for
      integrity and proof of residency on Host

   As part of agent start/restart process, linux integrity measurement
   architecture (linux-ima) is used to ensure that only approved
   executable for agent is loaded.

   Measurement collection: The agent executable is measured by linux-ima
   before it is loaded.  Local Verification: Enforce local validation of
   a measurement against a approved value stored in an extended
   attribute of the file.

   TPM attestation and remote server verification:

   *  Agent generates attestation key (AK) using TPM for proof of
      residency on H.

   *  Agent sends the AK attestation parameters (PCR quote, workload
      attestation public etc.) and EK certificate to the server

   *  Server inspects EK certificate.  If ca_path exists, and the EK
      certificate was signed by any chain in ca_path, validation passes

   *  If validation passed, the server generates a credential activation
      challenge.  The challenge's secret is encrypted using the EK
      public key.

   *  Server sends challenge to agent

   *  Agent decrypts the challenge's secret

   *  Agent sends back decrypted secret

   *  Server verifies that the decrypted secret is the same it used to
      build the challenge

   *  Server creates a SPIFFE ID along with the sha256sum of the TPM AK
      public key.  Server stores agent SPIFFE ID mapping to TPM AK
      public key in a shared datastore.

6.  Agent geo-location and geo-fencing workflow

   *  this is run periodically (say every 5 minutes) to ensure that the
      host is in the same location

6.1.  Step 1: Agent gets attested composite location using Geo-location
      service (GL)

   Geo-location service (GL) runs outside of H -- besides the location
   from device location sources (e.g. GPS, GNSS), it will connect to
   mobile location service providers (e.g., Telefonica) using GSMA
   location API (gsma-loc).

   *  Agent gathers the location from H local location sensors (e.g.
      GPS, GNSS).  Agent connects to GL using secure connection
      mechanism like TLS.  Agent provides the gathered location to GL
      over the secure connection.

   *  Location (L) has a quality associated with it.  For example, IP
      address-based L is of lower quality as compared to other sources.

   *  GL ensures that the device composition of H (reference to H
      composition table for further details) is intact (e.g. SIM card
      not plugged out of H) by periodically polling the state of H.  H
      is a member of the set of trusted hosts in the shared datastore --
      the shared datastore has the host composition details.  Note that
      e-SIM does not have the plugging out problem like standard SIM but
      could be subject to e-SIM swap attack.  Host composition (HC)
      comprises of TPM EK, Mobile-SIM etc.

   *  GL derives a combined location, including location quality, from
      various location sensors for a H with multiple location sensors --
      this includes the gathered location from Agent running on H.  As
      an example, GPS is considered less trustworthy as compared to
      mobile.

   *  The composite location comprises of combined geo-location (which
      includes location quality), host composition (TPM EK, mobile-SIM
      etc.) and time from a trusted source.  GL signs the composite
      location with a private key whose public key certificate is a
      public trusted transparent ledger such as certificate transparency
      log.  Now we have a attested composite location.

   *  Agent is returned the attested composite location over the secure
      connection.  Agent signs the attested composite location using TPM
      AK establishing proof of residency of composite location to H.
      This is called attested proof-of-residency aware composite
      location (APL).

6.2.  Step 2: Agent gets attested geographic boundary using Geo-fencing
      (GF) service

   *  Geo-fence policies are of four flavours - (1) boolean membership
      of given boundary (rectangular, circular, state etc.), (2) precise
      location, (3) precise bounding box/circle of location, (4)
      approximate location with no definition of boundary.  The first
      one, boolean membership of given boundary, is the most common and
      will be assumed as the default.  They are available in the form of
      pre-defined templates or can be configured on demand.
      Enterprises, who are the user of the hosts, choose the geo-fence
      policies to be enforced for various hosts.  Note that the hosts
      must belong to the set of trusted hosts in a shared ledger.  The
      geo-fence policies applied to the set of trusted hosts are
      recorded in a shared ledger.

   *  Location agent on H supplies (APL) to geo-fence service (GF) over
      a secure connection.  GF performs geo-fence policy enforcement by
      matching the location against configured geo-fence policies.  GF
      signs the geo-fence policy match result, along with a trusted time
      (potentially leverage RFC 3161), with a private key whose public
      key certificate is a public trusted transparent ledger such as
      certificate transparency log.

   *  Geo-fence policy match result details (non-exhaustive): 1) Geo-
      fence policy which matched 2) Boolean - inside or outside geo-
      fence - applicable to boolean membership of given boundary policy
      type.

   *  Agent is returned the attested geo-fence policy match result.
      Agent signs the attested geo-fence policy match result using TPM
      AK establishing proof of residency of geo-fence policy match
      result to H.  This is called attested proof-of-residency aware
      geo-fence policy match result (APGL).

7.  Workload (W) attestation and remote verification - key steps

   *  Agent ensures that W connects to it on H local socket (e.g. Unix
      domain socket).  Agent generates private/public key pair for W.
      Agent signs the W public key with its TPM AK.  Agent sends the
      signed W public key along with its SPIFFE ID and last known APGL
      to the server.  Note that the TPM AK is already verified by the
      server as part of the agent attestation process establishing proof
      of residency of Agent to H.

   *  Server gets the Agent TPM AK public key from the SPIFFE ID by
      looking it up in the shared datastore.  Server verifies the W
      public key signature using the TPM AK public key.  Server then
      sends an encrypted challenge to the agent.  The challenge's secret
      is encrypted using the W public key.

   *  Agent decrypts the challenge using its W private key and sends the
      response back to the server.

   *  Server verifies that the decrypted secret is the same it used to
      build the challenge.  It then issues SPIFFE ID for W.  The SPIFFE
      ID is signed by the server and contains the W public key and the
      geographic boundary (e.g. cloud region, city, country etc.) of the
      host.  The geographic boundary is obtained from the last known
      APGL.  The server also stores the W SPIFFE ID mapping to W public
      key in a shared datastore.

8.  Networking Protocol Changes

   Workload ID (WID), with location field, in the form of a proof-of-
   residency certificate or token needs to be conveyed to the peer
   during connection establishment.  The connection is end-to-end across
   proxies like

8.1.  Using TLS

   *  HTTP session termination (SASE firewall, API gateways etc.) -
      terminate and re-establish TLS.

   *  RDP latest version - terminate and re-establish TLS; tcp/ip.

   *  SCTP session termination (Mobile network SASE firewall etc.) -
      terminate and re-establish TLS; sctp/ip; does not use TCP or UDP.

   *  NFS - terminate and re-establish TLS; tcp/ip.

8.2.  Not Using TLS

   *  SSH tunnel (Jump hosts etc.) - terminate and re-establish ssh;
      tcp/ip; does not use TLS.

   *  IPSEC tunnel (Router control plane etc.) - terminates IPSEC tunnel
      and forwards encapsulated traffic; ip; does not use TLS.

8.3.  Approaches

   *  Enhance applications (e.g. MCP protocol) to convey Workload ID
      (WID), with location field.

   *  Enhance HTTP headers to convey Workload ID (WID), with location
      field.

   *  Enhance TLS to convey Workload ID (WID), with location field.

   *  Enhance SSH/IPSEC to convey Workload ID (WID), with location
      field.

                                 Table 1

   *Note*: A GPS sensor with a cryptographic signature, also known as
   GNSS signal authentication, uses digital signatures in the broadcast
   signal to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the GPS data,
   protecting against spoofing attacks.

10.  Authorization Policy Implementers

   Policy Implementers use attested a geographic boundary from W to make
   decisions.  Example implementers:

   *  SaaS application.

   *  K8s node agent.

   *  OS process scheduler.

   If the policy implementer is at the SaaS application level, things
   are simpler.  However, if it is pushed down to, say, K8s or OS
   process scheduler or JVM class loader/deserializer, then malware can
   be prevented (similar to code-signed application).

11.  Security Considerations

   The proposed framework introduces several security considerations
   that must be addressed to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of
   geo-fencing:

   *  *TPM and Hardware Trust*: The security of the solution depends on
      the integrity of the TPM and other hardware roots of trust.
      Physical attacks, firmware vulnerabilities, or supply chain
      compromises could undermine attestation.  Regular updates, secure
      provisioning, and monitoring are required.

   *  *Geo-location Spoofing*: Location sensors (e.g., GPS) are
      susceptible to spoofing or replay attacks.  Use of
      cryptographically authenticated signals (e.g., Galileo GNSS,
      Mobile network) and cross-verification with multiple sources can
      mitigate this risk.

   *  *SIM and e-SIM Attacks*: Physical SIM removal or e-SIM swap
      attacks can break the binding between device and location.
      Continuous monitoring of device composition and periodic re-
      attestation are recommended.

   *  *Software Integrity*: The geo-location agent and supporting
      software must be protected against tampering.  Use of Linux IMA,
      secure boot, and measured launch environments helps ensure only
      approved software is executed.

   *  *Communication Security*: All attestation and geo-location data
      must be transmitted over secure, authenticated channels (e.g.,
      TLS) to prevent interception or manipulation.

   *  *Policy Enforcement*: The enforcement of geo-fence policies must
      be robust against attempts by malicious workloads or agents to
      bypass controls.  Policy decisions should be based on verifiable,
      signed attestation evidence.

   *  *Time Source Integrity*: Trusted time sources are necessary to
      prevent replay attacks and ensure the freshness of attestation
      data.

   *  *Datastore Security*: The shared datastore containing trusted host
      compositions and geo-fence policies must be protected against
      unauthorized access and tampering, using encryption and access
      controls.

   By addressing these considerations, the framework aims to provide a
   secure and reliable foundation for verifiable geo-fencing in diverse
   deployment environments.
