          Trustworthy and Verifiable Geofencing for Workloads
             draft-lkspa-wimse-verifiable-geo-fence-latest

Abstract

   Financial services, healthcare, and government entities have data
   residency requirements that aim to protect sensitive data by
   specifying its location.  Data location can be both geographic and
   host-centric.  Geolocation affinity means workloads are
   cryptographically bound to a geographic boundary.  Host affinity
   means workloads are cryptographically bound to a specific execution
   environment.  WIMSE architecture can be improved to show how location
   can be cryptographically bound to WIMSE identities.  This document
   augments WIMSE architecture to include geolocation and host affinity
   use cases and workflows.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a framework for trustworthy and verifiable
   geofencing of workloads.  It details use cases, architectural flows,
   and protocol enhancements that leverage trusted hardware (e.g., TPM),
   attestation protocols, and geolocation services.  The goal is to
   enable interoperable, cryptographically verifiable claims about
   workload residency and location, supporting compliance, security, and
   operational requirements in multi-system environments.

   As organizations increasingly adopt cloud and distributed computing,
   the need to enforce data residency, geolocation affinity, and host
   affinity has become critical for regulatory compliance and risk
   management.  Traditional approaches to geographic and host
   enforcement rely on trust in infrastructure providers or network-
   based controls, which are insufficient in adversarial or multi-tenant
   environments.

   Recent advances in trusted computing, remote attestation, and
   workload identity standards enable a new class of solutions where the
   geographic location and host integrity of workloads can be
   cryptographically attested and verified.  By binding workload
   identity to both platform and domain attributes, such as TPM-backed
   device identity and verifiable geographic boundaries, organizations
   can enforce fine-grained policies to define where and how sensitive
   workloads are executed.

   Data residency requirements are described in more detail in
   [tcg-geo-loc].

   An example of platform identity binding (i.e., host affinity) is
   described in [tcg-tpm].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use Cases

   Data residency use cases can be divided into three categories: (1)
   server-centric location, (2) user-centric location, and (3)
   regulatory compliance.

3.1.  Category 1: Server-centric Location

   Enterprises (e.g., healthcare, banking) need cryptographic proof of a
   trustworthy geographic boundary (i.e., region, zone, country, state,
   etc.) for cloud-facing workloads.

3.1.1.  Server workload <-> Server workload - General:

   Enterprises handling sensitive data rely on dedicated cloud hosts
   (e.g., EU sovereign cloud providers) that ensure compliance with data
   residency laws, while also ensuring appropriate levels of service
   (e.g., high availability).  To meet data residency legal
   requirements, enterprises need to verify that workload data is
   processed by hosts within a geographic boundary and that workload
   data is only transmitted between specified geographic boundaries.

3.1.2.  Server workload <-> Server workload - Agentic AI:

   Enterprises need to ensure that the AI agent is located within a
   specific geographic boundary when downloading sensitive data or
   performing other sensitive operations.  A secure AI agent, running on
   a trusted host with TPM-backed attestation, interacts with
   geolocation and geofencing services to obtain verifiable proof of its
   geographic boundary.  The agent periodically collects location data
   from trusted sensors, obtains attested composite location from a
   geolocation service, and enforces geofence policies via a geofencing
   service.  The resulting attested geofence proof is used to bind
   workload identity to both the host and its geographic location,
   enabling secure, policy-driven execution of AI workloads and
   compliance with data residency requirements.

   Figure -- Cybersecure and Compliant Agentic AI Workflow
   (https://github.com/nedmsmith/draft-klspa-wimse-verifiable-geo-
   fence/blob/main/pictures/secure-agentic-workflow.svg/)

3.1.3.  Server workload <-> Server workload - Federated AI:

   In federated learning scenarios, multiple organizations collaborate
   to train machine learning models without sharing raw data.  Each
   organization needs to ensure that its training data remains within a
   specific geographic boundary.  This requires cryptographic proof that
   the training process is occurring on trusted hosts within the defined
   boundaries.

3.1.4.  User workload <-> Server workload:

   Enterprises ensure that they are communicating with a server (e.g.,
   cloud services) located within a specific geographic boundary.

3.2.  Category 2: User-centric Location

   Enterprises need cryptographic proof of trustworthy geographic
   boundary for user-facing workloads.

   *  A server (or proxy) authenticates to clients using different TLS
      certificates, each signed by a different Certificate Authority
      (CA), based on the geographic boundaries of user workloads.

   *  Enterprise Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) provides on-premises
      computing that is a basis for defining geolocation boundaries.  A
      telco network provides a means for communication between premises.

   *  Construction & Engineering of SaaS workloads can benefit from
      attested geographic boundary data from end-user devices to
      restrict access within specific geopolitical regions (e.g.,
      California).  Enabling per-user or group-level geofencing helps
      prevent fraudulent access originating outside the authorized area.

   *  Healthcare providers need to ensure that the host is located in a
      specific geographic boundary when downloading patient data or
      performing other sensitive operations.

   *  U.S.  Presidential Executive Order (doj-cisa) compliance directs
      Cloud Service Provider (CSP) support personnel be located in
      restricted geographies (e.g., Venezuela, Iran, China, North
      Korea).  However, those personnel should not be allowed to support
      U.S. customers.  Geolocation enforcement can ensure policy
      compliance.  See [doj-cisa].

3.3.  Category 3: Regulatory Compliance

   Geographic boundary attestation helps satisfy data residency and data
   sovereignty requirements for regulatory compliance.

4.  Problem Statements

   *  *Bearer Tokens:* Typically generated via user MFA and used to
      establish HTTP sessions.  A malicious actor can steal a bearer
      token (e.g., from a still-valid HAR file uploaded to a support
      portal, as seen in the Okta attack) and present it to a server
      workload.  The attacker may be in a forbidden location and on an
      unauthorized host (e.g., their own laptop).  Proof-of-Possession
      (PoP) tokens (RFC 7800 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/
      rfc7800)) and PoP via mutual TLS (RFC 8705
      (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705)) attempt to
      mitigate this threat, but face the challenges described below.

   *  *PoP Token:* How is trust established between the presenter
      (client) and the token issuer, so that the presenter can securely
      connect to the recipient (server)?

   *  *PoP via Mutual TLS:* Client certificates are generally not
      supported in browsers.  In production, man-in-the-middle entities
      such as API gateways often terminate TLS connections, breaking the
      end-to-end trust model.

   *  *Host TPMs for Signature:* It is not scalable to sign every API
      call with a TPM key, as typical enterprise laptops/servers support
      only about 5 signatures per second (source
      (https://stiankri.substack.com/p/tpm-performance)).

   *  *IP Address-Based Location:* This is the typical approach, but it
      has limitations: network providers can use geographic-region-based
      IANA-assigned IP addresses anywhere in the world, and enterprise
      VPNs can hide the user's real IP address.

   *  *Wi-Fi-Based Location:* For user laptop endpoints with agents
      (e.g., ZTNA), traditional geographic enforcement relies on
      trusting the Wi-Fi access point’s location.  However, Wi-Fi access
      points are mobile and can be moved, undermining this trust.

5.  Approach Summary

   Host contains location devices like mobile sensor, GPS sensor, GNSS
   sensor, etc.  Host is a compute node, including servers, routers, and
   end-user appliances like smartphones, tablets, or PCs.  Host has a
   discrete TPM.  Note on TPM: The EK certificate is a digital
   certificate signed by the TPM manufacturer's CA which verifies the
   identity and trustworthiness of the TPM's Endorsement Key (EK); TPM
   attestation key (AK) is cryptographically backed by TPM EK.  For the
   initial version of the draft, host is bare metal Linux OS host and
   interactions are with TPM.

   Trusted hosts are the hosts which have trustworthy device composition
   (TPM EK, Mobile-SIM, GPS device ID, etc.), endorsed by manufacturer/
   owner, and use a trustworthy OS.  A set of trusted hosts along with
   the device composition details and OS details are recorded in a
   shared data store (database or ledger) by the host owner.

   Workload and agent run on a set of trusted hosts.  Workload can be a
   server app, a mobile/PC app (including browser), or a network host
   (e.g., router).  Proof of residency of workload on a trusted host is
   obtained using TPM.  Workload asks its agent for proof, which in turn
   asks TPM for AK-attested proof.

   Agent sends attested geographic boundary (e.g., cloud region, city,
   country, etc.) and workload's parameters to Workload Identity Manager
   (WIM).

   *  Example for agent used in this document: SPIFFE/SPIRE agent
      (spire) can be enhanced to add attested geographic boundary that
      will become part of identity granted (e.g., SVID).

   *  Example for WIM used in this document: SPIFFE/SPIRE server

   *  WIM gives signed Workload ID (WID) with geographic boundary as an
      additional field.  This could be a certificate or a token.

6.  SPIFFE/SPIRE Architecture Modifications

   In the context of the SPIFFE/SPIRE architecture (spire), the SPIFFE/
   SPIRE agent includes a new geolocation plugin -- this is depicted in
   the figure below.  The agent is a daemon running on bare-metal Linux
   OS host (H) as a process with direct access to TPM (root permissions
   for TPM 2.0 access may be needed for certain Linux distributions for
   certain H hardware configurations).  The agent, using the geolocation
   plugin, can gather the location from host-local location sensors
   (e.g., GPS, GNSS).  The agent has a TPM plugin (spire-tpm) which
   interacts with the TPM.  The server (SPIFFE/SPIRE server) is running
   in a cluster which is isolated from the cluster in which the agent is
   running.

   plugin (https://github.com/nedmsmith/draft-klspa-wimse-verifiable-
   geo-fence/blob/main/pictures/spiffe-spire.svg)

7.  End-to-End Workflow

   The end-to-end workflow for the proposed framework consists of
   several key steps, including attestation for system bootstrap and
   agent initialization, agent geolocation and geofencing processing,
   workload attestation, and remote verification.

   Figure -- End-to-end Workflow (https://github.com/nedmsmith/draft-
   klspa-wimse-verifiable-geo-fence/blob/main/pictures/end-to-end-
   flow.svg)

7.1.  Attestation for System Bootstrap and Agent Initialization

7.1.1.  Attestation of OS Integrity and Proof of Residency on Host

   As part of system boot/reboot process, boot loader-based measured
   system boot with remote SPIFFE/SPIRE server verification is used to
   ensure only approved OS is running on an approved hardware platform.

   Measurement Collection: During the boot process, the boot loader
   collects measurements (hashes) of the boot components and
   configurations.  The boot components are Firmware/BIOS/UEFI,
   bootloader, OS, drivers, location devices, and initial programs.  All
   the location devices (e.g., GPS sensor, mobile sensor) version/
   firmware in a platform are measured during each boot -- this is a
   boot loader enhancement.  Any new location device which is hot-
   swapped in will be evaluated for inclusion only during next reboot.

   Log Creation: These measurements are recorded in a log, often
   referred to as the TCGLog, and stored in the TPM's Platform
   Configuration Registers (PCRs).

   Attestation Report: The TPM generates an attestation report, which
   includes the signed measurements and the boot configuration log.  The
   signature of the attestation report (aka quote) is by a TPM
   attestation key (AK).  This attestation includes data about the TPM's
   state and can be used to verify that the AK is indeed
   cryptographically backed by the TPM EK certificate.

   Transmission: The attestation report is then sent to an external
   verifier (server), through a secure TLS connection.

   Remote Verification: The remote server checks the integrity of the
   attestation report and validates the measurements against known good
   values from the set of trusted hosts in the shared data store.  The
   server also validates that the TPM EK certificate has not been
   revoked and is part of the approved list of TPM EK identifiers
   associated with the hardware platform.  At this point, we can be sure
   that the hardware platform is approved for running workloads and is
   running an approved OS.

7.1.2.  Start/restart time attestation/remote verification of agent for
        integrity and proof of residency on Host

   As part of agent start/restart process, Linux Integrity Measurement
   Architecture (Linux IMA) is used to ensure that only approved
   executable for agent is loaded.

   Measurement collection: The agent executable is measured by Linux IMA
   before it is loaded.  Local Verification: Enforce local validation of
   a measurement against an approved value stored in an extended
   attribute of the file.

   TPM attestation and remote server verification:

   *  Agent generates attestation key (AK) using TPM for proof of
      residency on H.

   *  Agent sends the AK attestation parameters (PCR quote, workload
      attestation public key, etc.) and EK certificate to the server.

   *  Server inspects EK certificate.  If CA path exists, and the EK
      certificate was signed by any chain in CA path, validation passes.

   *  If validation passed, the server generates a credential activation
      challenge.  The challenge's secret is encrypted using the EK
      public key.

   *  Server sends challenge to agent.

   *  Agent decrypts the challenge's secret.

   *  Agent sends back decrypted secret.

   *  Server verifies that the decrypted secret is the same it used to
      build the challenge.

   *  Server creates a SPIFFE ID along with the SHA-256 sum of the TPM
      AK public key.  Server stores agent SPIFFE ID mapping to TPM AK
      public key in a shared data store.

7.2.  Agent Geolocation and Geofencing Workflow

   *  This is run periodically (say every 5 minutes) to ensure that the
      host is in the same location.

7.2.1.  Step 1: Agent gets attested composite location using Geolocation
        Service (GL)

   Geolocation service (GL) runs outside of host -- besides the location
   from device location sources (e.g., GPS, GNSS), it will connect to
   mobile location service providers (e.g., Telefonica) using GSMA
   location API (gsma-loc).

   *  Agent gathers the location from host-local location sensors (e.g.,
      GPS, GNSS).  Agent connects to GL using a secure connection
      mechanism like TLS.  Agent provides the gathered location to GL
      over the secure connection.

   *  Location has a quality associated with it.  For example, IP
      address-based location is of lower quality as compared to other
      sources.

   *  GL ensures that the device composition of host (reference to Host
      Composition Table for further details) is intact (e.g., SIM card
      not plugged out of host) by periodically polling the state of
      host.  Host is a member of the set of trusted hosts in the shared
      data store, which contains the host composition details.  Note
      that e-SIM does not have the plugging out problem like standard
      SIM but could be subject to e-SIM swap attack.  Host composition
      (HC) comprises TPM EK, Mobile-SIM, etc.

   *  GL derives a combined location, including location quality, from
      various location sensors for a host with multiple location sensors
      -- this includes the gathered location from agent running on host.
      As an example, GPS is considered less trustworthy as compared to
      mobile.

   *  The composite location comprises combined geolocation (which
      includes location quality), host composition (TPM EK, mobile-SIM,
      etc.), and time from a trusted source.  GL signs the composite
      location with a private key whose public key certificate is in a
      public, trusted, transparent ledger such as a certificate
      transparency log.  Now we have an attested composite location.

   *  Agent is returned the attested composite location over the secure
      connection.  Agent signs the attested composite location using TPM
      AK, establishing proof of residency of composite location to host.
      This is called attested, proof-of-residency-aware composite
      location (APL).

7.2.2.  Step 2: Agent gets attested geographic boundary using Geofencing
        (GF) Service

   *  Geofence policies are of four flavors: (1) boolean membership of
      given boundary (rectangular, circular, state, etc.), (2) precise
      location, (3) precise bounding box/circle of location, (4)
      approximate location with no definition of boundary.  The first
      one, boolean membership of given boundary, is the most common and
      will be assumed as the default.  They are available in the form of
      pre-defined templates or can be configured on demand.
      Enterprises, who are the users of the hosts, choose the geofence
      policies to be enforced for various hosts.  Note that the hosts
      must belong to the set of trusted hosts in a shared ledger.  The
      geofence policies applied to the set of trusted hosts are recorded
      in a shared ledger.

   *  Location agent on host supplies (APL) to geofence service (GF)
      over a secure connection.  GF performs geofence policy enforcement
      by matching the location against configured geofence policies.  GF
      signs the geofence policy match result, along with a trusted time
      (potentially leveraging RFC 3161), with a private key whose public
      key certificate is in a public, trusted, transparent ledger such
      as a certificate transparency log.

   *  Geofence policy match result details (non-exhaustive): 1) Geofence
      policy which matched 2) Boolean - inside or outside geofence -
      applicable to boolean membership of given boundary policy type.

   *  Agent is returned the attested geofence policy match result.
      Agent signs the attested geofence policy match result using TPM
      AK, establishing proof of residency of geofence policy match
      result to host.  This is called attested, proof-of-residency-aware
      geofence policy match result (APGL).

7.3.  Workload (W) Attestation and Remote Verification - Key Steps

   *  Agent ensures that workload connects to it on a host-local socket
      (e.g., Unix-domain socket).  Agent generates private/public key
      pair for workload.  Agent signs the workload public key with its
      TPM AK.  Agent sends the signed workload public key along with its
      SPIFFE ID and last known APGL to the server.  Note that the TPM AK
      is already verified by the server as part of the agent attestation
      process, establishing proof of residency of agent to host.

   *  Server gets the agent TPM AK public key from the SPIFFE ID by
      looking it up in the shared data store.  Server verifies the
      workload public key signature using the TPM AK public key.  Server
      then sends an encrypted challenge to the agent.  The challenge's
      secret is encrypted using the workload public key.

   *  Agent decrypts the challenge using its workload private key and
      sends the response back to the server.

   *  Server verifies that the decrypted secret is the same it used to
      build the challenge.  It then issues SPIFFE ID for workload.  The
      SPIFFE ID is signed by the server and contains the workload public
      key and the geographic boundary (e.g., cloud region, city,
      country, etc.) of the host.  The geographic boundary is obtained
      from the last known APGL.  The server also stores the workload
      SPIFFE ID mapping to workload public key in a shared data store.

8.  Networking Protocol Changes

   Workload ID (WID), with location field, in the form of a proof-of-
   residency certificate or token, needs to be conveyed to the peer
   during connection establishment.  The connection is end-to-end across
   proxies like:

8.1.  Using TLS

   *  HTTP session termination (SASE firewall, API gateways, etc.) -
      terminate and re-establish TLS.

   *  RDP latest version - terminate and re-establish TLS; TCP/IP.

   *  SCTP session termination (Mobile network SASE firewall, etc.) -
      terminate and re-establish TLS; SCTP/IP; Does not use TCP or UDP.

   *  NFS - terminate and re-establish TLS; TCP/IP.

8.2.  Not Using TLS

   *  SSH tunnel (jump hosts, etc.) - terminate and re-establish SSH;

10.  Authorization Policy Implementers

   Policy implementers use attested geographic boundary from W to make
   decisions.  Example implementers:

   *  SaaS application.

   *  K8s node agent.

   *  OS process scheduler.

   If the policy implementer is at the SaaS application level, things
   are simpler.  However, if it is pushed down to, say, K8s or OS
   process scheduler or JVM class loader/deserializer, then malware can
   be prevented (similar to a code-signed application).

11.  Security Considerations

   The proposed framework introduces several security considerations
   that must be addressed to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of
   geofencing:

   *  *TPM and Hardware Trust*: The security of the solution depends on
      the integrity of the TPM and other hardware roots of trust.
      Physical attacks, firmware vulnerabilities, or supply chain
      compromises could undermine attestation.  Regular updates, secure
      provisioning, and monitoring are required.

   *  *Geolocation Spoofing*: Location sensors (e.g., GPS) are
      susceptible to spoofing or replay attacks.  Use of
      cryptographically authenticated signals (e.g., Galileo GNSS,
      mobile network) and cross-verification with multiple sources can
      mitigate this risk.

   *  *SIM and e-SIM Attacks*: Physical SIM removal or e-SIM swap
      attacks can break the binding between device and location.
      Continuous monitoring of device composition and periodic re-
      attestation are recommended.

   *  *Software Integrity*: The geolocation agent and supporting
      software must be protected against tampering.  Use of Linux IMA,
      secure boot, and measured launch environments helps ensure only
      approved software is executed.

   *  *Communication Security*: All attestation and geolocation data
      must be transmitted over secure, authenticated channels (e.g.,
      TLS) to prevent interception or manipulation.

   *  *Policy Enforcement*: The enforcement of geofence policies must be
      robust against attempts by malicious workloads or agents to bypass
      controls.  Policy decisions should be based on verifiable, signed
      attestation evidence.

   *  *Time Source Integrity*: Trusted time sources are necessary to
      prevent replay attacks and ensure the freshness of attestation
      data.

   *  *Data Store Security*: The shared data store containing trusted
      host compositions and geofence policies must be protected against
      unauthorized access and tampering, using encryption and access
      controls.

   By addressing these considerations, the framework aims to provide a
   secure and reliable foundation for verifiable geofencing in diverse
   deployment environments.
