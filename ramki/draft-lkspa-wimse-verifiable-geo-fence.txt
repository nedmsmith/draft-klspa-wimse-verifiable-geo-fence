          Trustworthy and Verifiable Geofencing for Workloads
             draft-lkspa-wimse-verifiable-geo-fence-latest

Abstract

   Financial services, healthcare, and government entities have data
   residency requirements that aim to protect sensitive data by
   specifying its location.  Data location can be both geographic and
   host-centric.  Geolocation affinity means workloads are
   cryptographically bound to a geographic boundary.  Host affinity
   means workloads are cryptographically bound to a specific execution
   environment.  WIMSE architecture can be improved to show how location
   can be cryptographically bound to WIMSE identities.  This document
   augments WIMSE architecture to include geolocation and host affinity
   use cases and workflows.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a framework for trustworthy and verifiable
   geofencing of workloads.  It details use cases, architectural flows,
   and protocol enhancements that leverage trusted hardware (e.g., TPM),
   attestation protocols, and geolocation services.  The goal is to
   enable interoperable, cryptographically verifiable claims about
   workload residency and location, supporting compliance, security, and
   operational requirements in multi-system environments.

   As organizations increasingly adopt cloud and distributed computing,
   the need to enforce data residency, geolocation affinity, and host
   affinity has become critical for regulatory compliance and risk
   management.  Traditional approaches to geographic and host
   enforcement rely on trust in infrastructure providers or network-
   based controls, which are insufficient in adversarial or multi-tenant
   environments.

   Recent advances in trusted computing, remote attestation, and
   workload identity standards enable a new class of solutions where the
   geographic location and host integrity of workloads can be
   cryptographically attested and verified.  By binding workload
   identity to both platform and domain attributes, such as TPM-backed
   device identity and verifiable geographic boundaries, organizations
   can enforce fine-grained policies to define where and how sensitive
   workloads are executed.

   Data residency requirements are described in more detail in
   [tcg-geo-loc].

   An example of platform identity binding (i.e., host affinity) is
   described in [tcg-tpm].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use Cases

   Data residency use cases can be divided into three categories: (1)
   server-centric location, (2) user-centric location, and (3)
   regulatory compliance.

3.1.  Category 1: Server-centric Location

   Enterprises (e.g., healthcare, banking) need cryptographic proof of a
   trustworthy geographic boundary (i.e., region, zone, country, state,
   etc.) for cloud-facing workloads.

3.1.1.  Server workload <-> Server workload - General:

   Enterprises handling sensitive data rely on dedicated cloud hosts
   (e.g., EU sovereign cloud providers) that ensure compliance with data
   residency laws, while also ensuring appropriate levels of service
   (e.g., high availability).  To meet data residency legal
   requirements, enterprises need to verify that workload data is
   processed by hosts within a geographic boundary and that workload
   data is only transmitted between specified geographic boundaries.

3.1.2.  Server workload <-> Server workload - Agentic AI:

   Enterprises need to ensure that the AI agent is located within a
   specific geographic boundary when downloading sensitive data or
   performing other sensitive operations.  A secure AI agent, running on
   a trusted host with TPM-backed attestation, interacts with
   geolocation and geofencing services to obtain verifiable proof of its
   geographic boundary.  The agent periodically collects location data
   from trusted sensors, obtains attested composite location from a
   geolocation service, and enforces geofence policies via a geofencing
   service.  The resulting attested geofence proof is used to bind
   workload identity to both the host and its geographic location,
   enabling secure, policy-driven execution of AI workloads and
   compliance with data residency requirements.

   Figure -- Cybersecure and Compliant Agentic AI Workflow
   (https://github.com/nedmsmith/draft-klspa-wimse-verifiable-geo-
   fence/blob/main/pictures/secure-agentic-workflow.svg/)

3.1.3.  Server workload <-> Server workload - Federated AI:

   In federated learning scenarios, multiple organizations collaborate
   to train machine learning models without sharing raw data.  Each
   organization needs to ensure that its training data remains within a
   specific geographic boundary.  This requires cryptographic proof that
   the training process is occurring on trusted hosts within the defined
   boundaries.

3.1.4.  User workload <-> Server workload:

   Enterprises ensure that they are communicating with a server (e.g.,
   cloud services) located within a specific geographic boundary.

3.2.  Category 2: User-centric Location

   Enterprises need cryptographic proof of trustworthy geographic
   boundary for user-facing workloads.

   *  A server (or proxy) authenticates to clients using different TLS
      certificates, each signed by a different Certificate Authority
      (CA), based on the geographic boundaries of user workloads.

   *  Enterprise Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) provides on-premises
      computing that is a basis for defining geolocation boundaries.  A
      telco network provides a means for communication between premises.

   *  Construction & Engineering of SaaS workloads can benefit from
      attested geographic boundary data from end-user devices to
      restrict access within specific geopolitical regions (e.g.,
      California).  Enabling per-user or group-level geofencing helps
      prevent fraudulent access originating outside the authorized area.

   *  Healthcare providers need to ensure that the host is located in a
      specific geographic boundary when downloading patient data or
      performing other sensitive operations.

   *  U.S.  Presidential Executive Order (doj-cisa) compliance directs
      Cloud Service Provider (CSP) support personnel be located in
      restricted geographies (e.g., Venezuela, Iran, China, North
      Korea).  However, those personnel should not be allowed to support
      U.S. customers.  Geolocation enforcement can ensure policy
      compliance.  See [doj-cisa].

3.3.  Category 3: Regulatory Compliance

   Geographic boundary attestation helps satisfy data residency and data
   sovereignty requirements for regulatory compliance.

4.  Problem Statements

   *  *Bearer Tokens:* Typically generated via user MFA and used to
      establish HTTP sessions.  A malicious actor can steal a bearer
      token (e.g., from a still-valid HAR file uploaded to a support
      portal, as seen in the Okta attack) and present it to a server
      workload.  The attacker may be in a forbidden location and on an
      unauthorized host (e.g., their own laptop).  Proof-of-Possession
      (PoP) tokens ([RFC-7800]) and PoP via mutual TLS ([RFC-8705])
      attempt to mitigate this threat, but face the challenges described
      below.

   *  *PoP Token:* How is trust established between the presenter
      (client) and the token issuer, so that the presenter can securely
      connect to the recipient (server)?

   *  *PoP via Mutual TLS:* Client certificates are generally not
      supported in browsers.  In production, man-in-the-middle entities
      such as API gateways often terminate TLS connections, breaking the
      end-to-end trust model.

   *  *Host TPMs for Signature:* It is not scalable to sign every API
      call with a TPM key, as typical enterprise laptops/servers support
      only about 5 signatures per second ([tpm-performance]).

   *  *IP Address-Based Location:* This is the typical approach, but it
      has limitations: network providers can use geographic-region-based
      IANA-assigned IP addresses anywhere in the world, and enterprise
      VPNs can hide the user's real IP address.

   *  *Wi-Fi-Based Location:* For user laptop endpoints with agents
      (e.g., ZTNA), traditional geographic enforcement relies on
      trusting the Wi-Fi access point’s location.  However, Wi-Fi access
      points are mobile and can be moved, undermining this trust.

5.  Approach Summary

   This approach enables cryptographically verifiable geofencing by
   binding workload identity to both platform and geographic attributes
   using trusted hardware (e.g., TPM), attestation protocols, and
   geolocation services.  The framework supports secure, policy-driven
   enforcement of data residency and location requirements for workloads
   in multi-system environments.

   Key elements of the approach include: - *Trusted Hardware Roots:*
   Workload identity is anchored in hardware roots of trust such as
   TPMs, GNSS sensors, and mobile network modules, ensuring device
   integrity and authentic location data. - *Remote Attestation:*
   Workload Identity Agents collect measurements from the platform and
   location sensors, and use TPM-backed attestation to prove the
   integrity and residency of the workload to a remote Workload Identity
   Manager. - *Composite Location Claims:* The system combines multiple
   sources of location (e.g., GNSS, mobile network, Wi-Fi) and device
   composition (e.g., SIM, TPM EK) to create a composite, quality-scored
   location claim, which is cryptographically signed and verifiable. -
   *Policy Enforcement:* Workload Identity Managers and downstream
   policy implementers use these verifiable claims to enforce geofencing
   and data residency policies, ensuring that workloads only run or
   access data within approved geographic or jurisdictional boundaries.
   - *Continuous Monitoring:* The framework supports periodic re-
   attestation and monitoring of device composition and location,
   detecting changes such as SIM swaps or sensor removal that could
   affect trust. - *Interoperability:* The approach is designed to
   integrate with existing workload identity frameworks (e.g., SPIFFE/
   SPIRE), enabling adoption in cloud, edge, and enterprise
   environments.

   For example, in this document: * The *Workload Identity Manager* is
   represented by the SPIFFE/SPIRE server (spire).  * The *Workload
   Identity Agent* is represented by the SPIFFE/SPIRE agent (spire).

6.  SPIFFE/SPIRE Architecture Modifications

   In the context of the SPIFFE/SPIRE architecture (spire), the SPIFFE/
   SPIRE agent includes a new geolocation plugin -- this is depicted in
   the figure below.  The agent is a daemon running on bare-metal Linux
   OS host (H) as a process with direct access to TPM (root permissions
   for TPM 2.0 access may be needed for certain Linux distributions for
   certain H hardware configurations).  The agent, using the geolocation
   plugin, can gather the location from host-local location sensors
   (e.g., GNSS).  The agent has a TPM plugin (spire-tpm) which interacts
   with the TPM.  The Workload Identity Manager (SPIFFE/SPIRE server) is
   running in a cluster which is isolated from the cluster in which the
   agent is running.

   plugin (https://github.com/nedmsmith/draft-klspa-wimse-verifiable-
   geo-fence/blob/main/pictures/spiffe-spire.svg)

7.  Control Plane - End-to-End Workflow

   The end-to-end workflow for the proposed framework consists of
   several key steps, including attestation for system bootstrap and
   workload identity agent initialization, workload identity agent
   geolocation and geofencing processing, workload attestation, and
   remote verification.

   Figure -- End-to-end Workflow (https://github.com/nedmsmith/draft-
   klspa-wimse-verifiable-geo-fence/blob/main/pictures/end-to-end-
   flow.svg)

7.1.  Attestation for System Bootstrap and Workload Identity Agent
      Initialization

7.1.1.  Attestation of OS Integrity and Proof of Residency on Host

   As part of system boot/reboot process, boot loader-based measured
   system boot with remote workload identity manager verification is
   used to ensure only approved OS is running on an approved hardware
   platform.

   Measurement Collection: During the boot process, the boot loader
   collects measurements (hashes) of the boot components and
   configurations.  The boot components are Firmware/BIOS/UEFI,
   bootloader, OS, drivers, location devices, and initial programs.  All
   the location devices (e.g., GNSS sensor, mobile sensor) version/
   firmware in a platform are measured during each boot -- this is a
   boot loader enhancement.  Any new location device which is hot-
   swapped in will be evaluated for inclusion only during next reboot.

   Log Creation: These measurements are recorded in a log, often
   referred to as the TCGLog, and stored in the TPM's Platform
   Configuration Registers (PCRs).

   Attestation Report: The TPM generates an attestation report, which
   includes the signed measurements and the boot configuration log.  The
   signature of the attestation report (aka quote) is by a TPM
   attestation key (AK).  This attestation includes data about the TPM's
   state and can be used to verify that the AK is indeed
   cryptographically backed by the TPM EK certificate.

   Transmission: The attestation report is then sent to an external
   verifier (Workload Identity Manager), through a secure TLS
   connection.

   Remote Verification: The remote Workload Identity Manager checks the
   integrity of the attestation report and validates the measurements
   against known good values from the set of trusted hosts in the shared
   data store.  The shared data store can be split as follows for higher
   security - (1) Host TPM EKs (e.g., MDM) used by Workload Identity
   Manager and (2) Host TPM EKs + Geolocation sensor details (e.g.,
   location sensor hardware database).  The Workload Identity Manager
   also validates that the TPM EK certificate has not been revoked and
   is part of the approved list of TPM EK identifiers associated with
   the hardware platform.  At this point, we can be sure that the
   hardware platform is approved for running workloads and is running an
   approved OS.

7.1.2.  Start/Restart time attestation/remote verification of workload
        identity agent for integrity and proof of residency on Host

   As part of workload identity agent start process, Linux Integrity
   Measurement Architecture (Linux IMA) is used to ensure that only
   approved executable for agent is loaded.

   Measurement collection: For the workload identity agent start case,
   the agent executable is measured by Linux IMA, for example through
   cloud init and stored in TPM PCR through tools e.g., Linux ima-evm-
   utils before it is loaded.  For the workload identity agent restart
   case, it is not clear how the storage in TPM PCR will be accompished
   - TODO - ideally this should be natively handled in the IMA
   measurement process with an ability to retrigger on restart on
   refresh cycles.

   Local Verification: Enforce local validation of a measurement against
   an approved value stored in an extended attribute of the file.

   TPM attestation and remote Workload Identity Manager verification:

   *  Workload Identity Agent generates a private/public key pair and
      attestation key (AK) using TPM for proof of residency on H.

   *  Workload Identity Agent sends the public key and AK attestation
      parameters (PCR quote, workload attestation public key, etc.) and
      EK certificate to the Workload Identity Manager.

   *  Workload Identity Manager inspects EK certificate.  If CA path
      exists, and the EK certificate was signed by any chain in CA path,
      validation passes.

   *  If validation passed, the Workload Identity Manager generates a
      credential activation challenge.  The challenge's secret is
      encrypted using the EK public key and separately using the
      workload identity agent public key.

   *  Workload Identity Manager sends challenge to workload identity
      agent.

   *  Workload Identity Agent decrypts the challenge's secret.

   *  Workload Identity Agent sends back decrypted secret.

   *  Workload Identity Manager verifies that the decrypted secret is
      the same it used to build the challenge.

   *  Workload Identity Manager creates a SPIFFE ID along with the
      SHA-256 sum of the TPM AK public key appended with the SHA-256 sum
      of the workload identity agent public key.  Workload Identity
      Manager stores workload identity agent SPIFFE ID mapping to TPM AK
      public key in a shared data store.

8.  Geolocation Manager and Host Composition change tracking

   Geolocation Manager runs outside of host -- besides the location from
   device location sources (e.g., GNSS), it will connect to mobile
   location service providers (e.g., Telefonica) using GSMA location API
   (gsma-loc).  This described process below is run periodically (say
   every 5 minutes) to check if the host composition has changed.

   *  Workload Identity Agent periodically gathers host composition
      details (e.g. SIM card, location sensor) and sends to Geolocation
      Manager.

   *  Geolocation Manager can cross verify that the components of the
      host are still intact or if anything is plugged out.  Plugging out
      components can decrease the quality of location.  Host composition
      comprises TPM EK, GNSS sensor hardware id, Mobile sensor hardware
      id, Mobile-SIM IMSI, etc.  Refer to Host Composition Table for
      further details.  Note that e-SIM does not have the plugging out
      problem like standard SIM but could be subject to e-SIM swap
      attack.

8.1.  Workload Identity Agent Geolocation Workflow

   This described process below is run periodically (say every 1 minute)
   to check if the host's location has changed and get an attested
   location.

   *  Workload Identity Agent gathers the location from host-local
      location sensors (e.g., GNSS) and/or location providers (e.g.
      Google, Apple).  Location has a quality associated with it.  For
      example, IP address-based location is of lower quality as compared
      to other sources.  The location is signed by TPM AK along with a
      timestamp.  Workload Identity Agent provides the signed location
      to Workload Identity Manager using a nonce protocol to prevent
      replay attacks.

   *  Workload Identity Manager verifies the TPM AK of the signed
      location from the workload identity agent and provides it to
      Geolocation Manager.

   *  Geolocation Manager derives a combined location, including
      location quality, from various location sensors for a host with
      multiple location sensors -- this includes the gathered location
      from workload identity agent running on host.  As an example, GNSS
      is considered less trustworthy as compared to mobile.

   *  Geolocation Manager composite location comprises combined
      geolocation (which includes location quality), host composition
      (TPM EK, mobile-SIM, etc.), and time from a trusted source.

   *  Geolocation Manager converts the composite location to a
      geographic boundary comprising of city, state and country.

   *  Geolocation Manager signs the geographic boundary with a private
      key.  The public key certificate of Geolocation Manager is in a
      public, trusted, transparent ledger such as a certificate
      transparency log.  Geolocation Manager provides the signed
      geographic boundary to the Workload Identity Manager.

   *  Workload Identity Manager generates a host/workload geographic
      boundary token using the following fields - (1) issue time, (2)
      expiry time, (3) monotonically increasing nonce for
      troubleshooting, (4) Host TPM EK, (5) geographic boundary from
      geolocation manager, (6) workload agent ID (7) workload IDs
      (applicable to thick clients) - and attests it using its private
      key generating a host/workload geographic boundary token.

   *  The geographic boundary token is returned to the workload identity
      agent.  The public key certificate of Workload Identity Manager is
      in a public, trusted, transparent ledger such as a certificate
      transparency log and verifiable by the Workload Identity Agent.

   *Privacy centric design option*: Workload Identity Agent converts the
   gelocation to a geographic boundary comprising of city, state and
   country, before sending it to the workload identity manager.  This
   way, the workload identity manager does not have access to the exact
   location of the host.  The geographic boundary token is still signed
   by the Geolocation Manager and Workload Identity Manager.

   *Mobile network trust design option*: The mobile network operator can
   provide the location of the host to the Geolocation Manager, which
   can then derive the geographic boundary.  This is useful for mobile
   devices that may not have GNSS sensors or when GNSS is not available
   (e.g., indoors) or when GNSS (e.g. GPS) location is subject to
   spoofing.  The mobile network operator can provide the location of
   the host based on the mobile network's knowledge of the device's
   location, which is more trustworthy than the device's own location
   sensors.

8.2.  Workload Public Key Attestation and Remote Verification - Key
      Steps - This is the current workflow used by workload identity
      agent with TPM plugin

   Workload Identity Agent ensures that workload connects to it on a
   host-local socket (e.g., Unix-domain socket).  Workload Identity
   Agent generates private/public key pair for workload.  Workload
   Identity Agent signs the workload public key with its TPM AK.
   Workload Identity Agent sends the signed workload public key along
   with its SPIFFE ID.  Note that the TPM AK is already verified by the
   Workload Identity Manager as part of the workload identity agent
   attestation process, establishing proof of residency of workload
   identity agent to host.

   Workload Identity Manager gets the workload identity agent TPM AK
   public key from the SPIFFE ID by looking it up in the shared data
   store.  Workload Identity Manager verifies the workload public key
   signature using the TPM AK public key.  Workload Identity Manager
   then sends an encrypted challenge to the workload identity agent.
   The challenge's secret is encrypted using the workload public key.

   Workload Identity Agent decrypts the challenge using its workload
   private key and sends the response back to the Workload Identity
   Manager.

   Workload Identity Manager verifies that the decrypted secret is the
   same it used to build the challenge.  It then issues workload id
   (e.g. SPIFFE ID) for workload public key.  The workload is signed by
   the workload identity manager and contains the workload public key
   and TPM AK.

   Workload gets the its private key and workload ID from Workload
   Identity Agent.

9.  Data Plane - Networking Protocol Changes

   Workload ID (e.g. SPIFFE ID) and host/workload geographic boundary
   token, needs to be conveyed to the peer during connection
   establishment.  The connection is end-to-end across proxies like:

9.1.  Using TLS

   HTTP session termination (SASE firewall, API gateways, etc.) -
   terminate and re-establish TLS.

   RDP latest version - terminate and re-establish TLS; TCP/IP.

   SCTP session termination (Mobile network SASE firewall, etc.) -
   terminate and re-establish TLS; SCTP/IP; Does not use TCP or UDP.

   NFS - terminate and re-establish TLS; TCP/IP.

9.2.  Not Using TLS

   SSH tunnel (jump hosts, etc.) - terminate and re-establish SSH; TCP/
   IP; Does not use TLS.

   IPsec tunnel (router control plane, etc.) - terminates IPsec tunnel
   and forwards encapsulated traffic; IP; Does not use TLS.

9.3.  Approaches

   Enhance HTTP headers to convey Workload ID and host/workload
   geographic boundary token.  This is in the initial focus given the
   popularity of HTTP.  Benefits (1) This will cover Workload Identity
   Agent AI MCP protocol which uses HTTP 2.0. (2) Unlike TLS, HTTP
   headers are not terminated by proxies like API gateways, so the WID
   and host/workload geographic boundary token can be conveyed end-to-
   end.

   Enhance TLS to convey Workload ID and host/workload geographic
   boundary token.

   Enhance SSH/IPsec to convey Workload ID and host/workload geographic
   boundary token.

10.  Data Plane - HTTP header enhancement

   A new HTTP header field 'X-Workload-Geo-ID' is proposed for conveying
   the host/workload geographic boundary token.  The header fields are
   designed to be cryptographically verifiable, ensuring that the
   information is trustworthy and can be validated by intermediate
   proxies and servers.

10.1.  Thick client workload - Laptop/mobile host (e.g. microsoft teams
       laptop/desktop app), Data center host (e.g. microsoft teams
       server)

   The following steps describe the end-to-end workflow for a thick
   client workload (e.g., Microsoft Teams client) and a data center host
   (e.g., Microsoft Teams server) using the proposed HTTP header
   enhancements:

   *  Workload (e.g. microsoft teams client) gets Oauth bearer token for
      the cloud application (e.g. microsoft teams server) from the
      Authentication/Authorization server using the user credentials and
      workload credential using private key JWT (https://oauth.net/
      private-key-jwt/).  Private key JWT is alternative to shared
      client secret Oauth mechanism.

   *  Workload contacts the workload agent to

      -  Append the X-Workload-Geo-ID header field to the HTTP request,
         which contains (1) Current Host/workload geographic boundary
         token. (2) current timestamp (3) monotonically increasing nonce
         for troubleshooting.

      -  Sign the modified HTTP request using the workload identity
         agent private key.

   *  Intermediate proxies (e.g., API gateways, SASE firewalls) inspect
      the X-Workload-Geo-ID header field and perform the following
      checks:

      -  Verify that the host/workload geographic boundary token in the
         header is valid by verifying the signature against the workload
         identity manager public key and that the token has not expired.

      -  Verify that the workload agent ID in the host/workload
         geographic boundary token matches a allowed workload agent ID.

      -  Verify that the HTTP request signature in the host/workload
         geographic boundary token is valid by verifying it against the
         workload agent public key.

      -  If the verification passes, the request is forwarded to the
         destination server.  If the verification fails, the request is
         dropped, and an error response is generated.

   *  The server or Intermediate proxy can enforce policies based on the
      following fields in the host/workload geographic boundary token in
      X-Workload-Geo-ID header

      -  Host TPM EK, Workload Agent ID, geographic boundary and
         destination URL.

   *  The server can verify the X-Workload-Geo-ID header field by
      performing the following additional checks

      -  The server verifies that host/workload geographic boundary
         token has its workload ID.  It may be possible that the
         workload ID may have been key rotated - as long as the previous
         workload ID matches, it is acceptable.

10.2.  Thin client workload - Laptop/mobile host (e.g. microsoft teams
       browser app), Data center host (e.g. microsoft teams server)

   *  The key differences as compared to the thick client workload are:

      -  The browser extension, on behalf of the thin client, connects
         to the workload identity agent running on the host (e.g.,
         laptop/mobile) to sign the HTTP request with the workload
         identity agent private key.

      -  The server does not need to verify the workload ID in the host/
         workload geographic boundary token, as the workload ID is not
         present in the token.  The server or intermediate proxy can
         still enforce policies based on the host TPM EK, workload agent
         ID, geographic boundary, and destination URL.

11.  Token Format

12.  Host/Workload Geographic Boundary Token as SPIFFE JWT-SVID

   The host/workload geographic boundary token is issued as a SPIFFE
   JWT-SVID, following the SPIFFE JWT-SVID standard [spiffe-jwt-svid].
   This enables cryptographically verifiable claims about a host's
   geographic boundary, workloads running on the host, and hardware
   roots of trust, using a format interoperable with SPIFFE-based
   systems.  The JWT is signed by the Workload Identity Manager and is
   conveyed as a compact string (e.g., in the X-Workload-Geo-ID HTTP
   header).

12.1.  JWT-SVID Structure

   A SPIFFE JWT-SVID consists of three parts: - *Header*: Specifies the
   signing algorithm, token type, and optionally a key ID. - *Payload*:
   Contains the claims, including standard SPIFFE JWT-SVID claims and
   custom claims for geographic boundary attestation. - *Signature*:
   Cryptographic signature over the header and payload, created using
   the issuer's private key.

12.1.1.  JWT-SVID Header Example

   json { "alg": "RS256", "typ": "JWT", "kid": "key-id-1234" }

12.1.2.  JWT-SVID Payload Example

   json { "sub": "spiffe://example.org/host/123e4567-e89b-
   12d3-a456-426614174000", "aud": ["https://service.example.com"],
   "iat": 1718473200, "exp": 1718476800, "jti": "jwt-unique-id-5678",
   "nonce": 1234567890, "host_geographic_boundary": "San Jose,
   California, USA", "host_hardware_details": {
   "host_tpm_endorsement_public_key": "MIIBIjANBgkqh..." } }

   *Signature:* SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c

12.1.3.  Field Explanations

   *Standard SPIFFE JWT-SVID Claims:* - sub: The SPIFFE ID of the host
   or workload this token represents. - aud: Audience(s) for which this
   token is intended. - iat: Issued at time (UNIX timestamp). - exp:
   Expiration time (UNIX timestamp). - jti: JWT ID (unique identifier).

   *Custom Claims for Geographic Boundary:* - nonce: Unique, random
   unsigned long integer for replay protection. -
   host_geographic_boundary: The host's geographic boundary (city,
   state, country). - host_hardware_details: Object with hardware root
   of trust details (e.g., TPM EK public key).

13.  Authorization Policy Implementers

   Policy implementers use attested geographic boundary from Workload to
   make decisions.  Example implementers:

   *  Web application firewall, e.g., Istio Ingress/Egress Gateway

   *  SaaS application.

   *  K8s node agent.

   *  OS process scheduler.

   If the policy implementer is at the SaaS application level, things
   are simpler.  However, if it is pushed down to, say, K8s or OS
   process scheduler or JVM class loader/deserializer, then malware can
   be prevented (similar to a code-signed application).

14.  Security Considerations

   The proposed framework introduces several security considerations
   that must be addressed to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of
   geofencing:

   *  *TPM and Hardware Trust*: The security of the solution depends on
      the integrity of the TPM and other hardware roots of trust.
      Physical attacks, firmware vulnerabilities, or supply chain
      compromises could undermine attestation.  Regular updates, secure
      provisioning, and monitoring are required.

   *  *Geolocation Spoofing*: Location sensors (e.g., GPS) are
      susceptible to spoofing or replay attacks.  Use of
      cryptographically authenticated signals (e.g., Galileo GNSS,
      mobile network) and cross-verification with multiple sources can
      mitigate this risk.

   *  *SIM and e-SIM Attacks*: Physical SIM removal or e-SIM swap
      attacks can break the binding between device and location.
      Continuous monitoring of device composition and periodic re-
      attestation are recommended.

   *  *Software Integrity*: The geolocation agent and supporting
      software must be protected against tampering.  Use of Linux IMA,
      secure boot, and measured launch environments helps ensure only
      approved software is executed.

   *  *Communication Security*: All attestation and geolocation data
      must be transmitted over secure, authenticated channels (e.g.,
      TLS) to prevent interception or manipulation.

   *  *Policy Enforcement*: The enforcement of geofence policies must be
      robust against attempts by malicious workloads or agents to bypass
      controls.  Policy decisions should be based on verifiable, signed
      attestation evidence.

   *  *Time Source Integrity*: Trusted time sources are necessary to
      prevent replay attacks and ensure the freshness of attestation
      data.

   *  *Data Store Security*: The shared data store containing trusted
      host compositions must be protected against unauthorized access
      and tampering, using encryption and access controls.  The shared
      data store can be split as follows for higher security - 1) Host
      EKs (e.g., MDM) used by Workload Identity Manager and 2) Host EKs
      + Geolocation sensor details (e.g., location sensor hardware
      datastore)

   By addressing these considerations, the framework aims to provide a
   secure and reliable foundation for verifiable geofencing in diverse
   deployment environments.

15.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

16.  Appendix - Items to follow up

16.1.  Restart time attestation/remote verification of workload identity
       agent for integrity and proof of residency on Host

   For the workload identity agent restart case, it is not clear how the
   storage in TPM PCR will be accompished - TODO - ideally this should
   be natively handled in the IMA measurement process with an ability to
   retrigger on restart on refresh cycles.
