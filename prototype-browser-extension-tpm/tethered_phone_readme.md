# üîê  Bluetooth-Tether Proof  ‚Äì  PowerShell Checker

A single PowerShell script that answers one very specific question‚Äî**reliably and deterministically**:

> *‚ÄúIs this Windows machine‚Äôs active Bluetooth-tethered (PAN) connection coming  
> from **the one iPhone I trust**?‚Äù*

It does **not** rely on flaky WMI classes, registry tricks, or guessing from gateway MACs.  
Instead it pivots on Windows‚Äô Plug-and-Play **Container ID**: every physical phone and its child interfaces (PAN, audio, HID ‚Ä¶) share one GUID.  
The script finds the Bluetooth device in that same container, extracts its **public BD ADDR**, and compares it to the address you store in a tiny JSON file.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tethered_phone_check.ps1` | the checker script |
| `tethered_phone_info.json` | your phone‚Äôs friendly name and BD ADDR |

## ‚ú® Why this even matters

1. **Verifiable geo-fence** ‚Äì Gate secrets on ‚Äúlaptop is physically within a few meters of my phone.‚Äù  
2. **Zero install on the phone** ‚Äì Works with stock iOS / Android tethering.  
3. **Deterministic** ‚Äì No RSSI thresholds, no timer races.  
4. **Composable** ‚Äì Returns exit codes, so you can chain it in batch files, Scheduled Tasks, native-messaging hosts, TPM attestation, etc.
