# TPM-Backed Geolocation Attestation Prototype

This directory implements a prototype for secure, verifiable geolocation attestation using TPM-backed certificates. It is designed to work with a browser extension that collects geolocation data and communicates with this backend.

## Components

- **server.py**  
  Flask server that:
  - Receives geolocation data and TPM-signed tokens via HTTP headers.
  - Verifies the TPM signature using a certificate (`tpm_cert.pem`).
  - Checks nonce freshness to prevent replay attacks.
  - Converts coordinates to city/state/country using reverse geocoding.
  - Provides an endpoint (`/init_nonce`) for nonce initialization.

- **win-app.py**  
  Windows native messaging host that:
  - Reads geolocation data from stdin (from the browser extension).
  - Constructs a payload including latitude, longitude, accuracy, time, and nonce.
  - Signs the payload using a TPM-backed certificate via PowerShell.
  - Returns the signed token to the browser extension.

- **win-app.bat**  
  Batch file to launch `win-app.py` with the correct Python interpreter.

- **test-win-app.py**  
  Script to send a test geolocation message to the native messaging host for development/testing.

## Usage

### 1. TPM Certificate

Place your TPM-backed certificate in PEM format as `tpm_cert.pem` in this directory for the server to verify signatures.

### 2. Running the Server

```sh
python server.py
```
The server listens on port 8443 with TLS enabled (requires `cert.pem` and `key.pem`).

### 3. Running the Native Messaging Host

The browser extension should launch `win-app.py` (or use `win-app.bat`) as a native messaging host. It expects JSON messages with geolocation data and returns signed tokens.

### 4. Testing

You can use `test-win-app.py` to simulate sending geolocation data to the native messaging host.

## Protocol

- The browser extension collects geolocation data and sends it to the native messaging host.
- The host signs the data (with time and nonce) using the TPM and returns a token.
- The extension sends the token to the Flask server in the `X-Custom-Geolocation` HTTP header.
- The server verifies the signature, checks the nonce, and responds with region info.
