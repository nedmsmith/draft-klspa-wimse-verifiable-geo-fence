          Trustworthy and Verifiable Geo-fencing for Workloads
             draft-lkspa-wimse-verifiable-geo-fence-latest

Abstract

   Financial services, healthcare and government entities have data
   residency requirements, geo-location affinity and host affinity, to
   protect sensitive data.  Geo-location affinity necessitates workload
   being cryptographically bound to a geographic boundary.  Host
   affinity entails workload being cryptographically bound to a specific
   execution environment.  These requirements are well described in the
   Trusted Computing Group keynote and whitepaper on emerging use case
   and solutions [tcg-geo-loc].  From WIMSE perspective, to address
   these requirements, workload identity needs to be cryptographically
   bound to platform identity and domain identity.  Examples of platform
   identity are Device ID such as TPM [tcg-tpm] endorsement.  Examples
   of domain identity are Geographic boundary such as Geo-location
   area/region/country.  This draft aims to address the aforementioned
   gaps in WIMSE through use cases and high level architectural flows.

3.  Use Cases: Cryptographic Attestation of Geographic Boundaries

   Standardizing the attestation of a host’s geographic location enables
   interoperable enforcement of policy, compliance, and security
   guarantees across diverse deployment environments.  The following use
   cases motivate the need for a verifiable geographic claim.

3.1.  *Category 1*: Enterprise need cryptographic proof of trustworthy
      geographic boundary (region, zone, countries, state etc.) for
      cloud facing workloads

   *  *Server workload <-> Server workload*:

   Enterprises handling sensitive data—such as EU banks—rely on
   dedicated cloud hosts (e.g., EU sovereign cloud providers) to ensure
   high availability while complying with data residency laws.  To meet
   these requirements, they need to be able to verify the geographic
   boundary where their dedicated hosts are deployed.

   *  *User workload <-> Server workload*:

   (e.g. healthcare enterprise) ensuring that it is communicating with a
   server (e.g. cloud service) located within a specific geographic
   boundary.

3.2.  *Category 2*: Enterprise need cryptographic proof of trustworthy
      geographic boundary for user facing workloads

   *  A server (or proxy) authenticates to clients using different TLS
      certificates, each signed by a different Certificate Authority
      (CA), based on the geographic boundaries of user workloads.

   *  Enterprise on-premise Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) provides
      its geographic boundary using a mobile network.  This ensures that
      the Host (H) – a computing device such as a PC, phone, or router –
      connected to the CPE, is physically present on-premise.

   *  Construction & Engineering SaaS workloads can benefit immensely
      from attested geographic boundary data from end-user devices to
      restrict access within specific regions (e.g., California).
      Enabling per-user or group-level geo-fencing helps prevent
      fraudulent access originating outside the authorized area.

   *  Healthcare providers need to ensure that the Host (H) is located
      in a specific geographic boundary (countries e.g. US) when
      downloading patient data or performing other sensitive operations.

   *  U.S.  Presidential Executive Order compliance: For example, U.S.
      Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) may have support personnel located
      in a restricted geographic boundary (countries e.g., Venezuela,
      Iran, China, North Korea).  However, those personnel should not be
      allowed to support U.S. customers.  Geo-location enforcement can
      ensure policy compliance.  See [alert].

3.3.  *Category 3*: Security assurance and compliance

   Geographic boundary attestation helps satisfy data residency and data
   sovereignty requirements for regulatory compliance.

4.  High-level Approach

4.1.  Step 1

   Host (H) contains location Devices (HD) like mobile sensor, GPS
   sensor, WiFi sensor, GNSS sensor, etc.  H is a compute node,
   including servers, routers, and end-user appliances like smartphones
   or tablets or PCs.

4.2.  Step 2

   Location agent on H gets its attested location (L), and signed by,
   geo-location service (GL).  Signed location delivered as a
   certificate or signed token (e.g., JWT)?  Proof of Residency of
   location agent on H is obtained using vTPM.  Location agent asks vTPM
   for AIK-attested proof.

4.2.1.  GL can run inside H or outside of H:

   *  Inside H: Only GPS/GNSS device location sources are available or
      would like to maximize location privacy.

   *  Outside H: In turn will connect to mobile location service
      providers (e.g., Telefonica), and use other sources such as WiFi-
      based location service providers (e.g., Google) or device location
      sources (e.g., GNSS).

4.2.2.  Location Quality

   *  Location (L) has a quality associated with it.  For example, IP
      address-based L is of lower quality as compared to other sources.

4.2.3.  Definition of attested location generated by GL

   *  GL ensures that the composition of H is intact (e.g. SIM card not
      plugged out from CPE) by periodically polling the state of H.
      Note that e-SIM does not have the plugging out problem like
      standard SIM.

   *  GL derives a composite location, including location quality, from
      various location sensors for a H with multiple location sensors.

   *  GL signs the composite location, along with a trusted time, with a
      private key whose public key certificate is a public trusted
      transparent ledger such as certificate transparency log.

4.2.4.  Geo-location Service

   *  Geo-location service should check allowed hosts in a shared ledger
      (TPM EK, mobile-SIM).

   *  Note that the location is a property of H.  Other entities on H
      (e.g., an application) will have to associate with L through proof
      of residency on H.

4.3.  Step 3

   Geo-fence policies are of various types (rectangular, circular etc.).
   They are available in the form of pre-defined templates or can be
   configured on demand.  Enterprises choose the geo-fence policies to
   be enforced for various hosts.  Note that the hosts must belong to
   the list of allowed hosts in a shared ledger (TPM EK, mobile-SIM).
   The geo-fence policies applied to various hosts are recorded in a
   shared ledger.

4.4.  Step 4

   Location agent on H supplies attested location (L) to geo-fence
   service (GF) which performs geo-fence policy enforcement by matching
   the location against configured geo-fence policies (available in a
   shared ledger) and returns an attested geo-fence policy match result.

4.4.1.  Geo-fence policy engine is part of GF and uses L and quality of
        L to make decisions

   Geo-fence policy engine can be coded anywhere, including H such as a
   mobile app for maximizing privacy, a workload/server app, an workload
   orchestrator, an OS process scheduler, a JVM deserializer, or a
   storage server.

4.4.2.  Definition of attested geo-fence policy match result (GFL)

   Geo-fence policy match result details:

   *  Geo-fence policy hash which matched

   *  Boolean (inside or outside geo-fence)

   *  Distance from geo-fence

   GF signs the geo-fence policy match result, along with a trusted
   time, with a private key whose public key certificate is a public
   trusted transparent ledger such as certificate transparency log.

   GF logs geo-fence policy match result in a shared ledger.

4.4.3.  Log result in ledger - todo

4.5.  Step 5

   Workload (W) and Workload Agent run on H.  W can be a server app, a
   mobile/PC app (including browser), or a network host (e.g., router).

4.6.  Step 6

   Between W and H, there may be several layers of software (e.g.,
   baremetal, hypervisors, VMs, containers, etc.).  Our focus is on W
   and a virtual-TPM (vTPM) accessible to W, with vTPM transitively and
   securely linked to bare metal TPM.

   If W is directly on bare metal H, the vTPM = TPM on baremetal.

4.7.  Step 7

   Proof of Residency of W on H is obtained using vTPM.  W asks its
   Workload Agent for proof, which in turn asks vTPM for AIK-attested
   proof.  (Note: TPM-EK authenticity checked in ledger by Geo-fencing
   service earlier, as described above.)

   W’s Proof of Residency on H + H’s attested location from geo-fencing
   service = attested location for W

4.8.  Step 8

   Workload Agent sends attested location + W’s parameters to Workload
   Identity Manager (WIM).

   *  Example for a Workload Agent: SPIFFE/Spire agent can be enhanced
      to add attested location that will become part of Identity granted
      (e.g., SVID).

   *  Example for WIM: SPIFFE/Spire server

4.9.  Step 9

   Workload Identity Manager gives signed Workload ID (WID) with
   location as a field or location-matches boolean result as a field.
   This could be a certificate or a token.

5.  Networking Protocol Changes

   Workload ID (WID), with location field, in the form of a proof-of-
   residency certificate or token needs to be conveyed to the peer
   during connection established.  The connection is end-to-end across
   proxies like

5.1.  Using TLS

   *  HTTP session termination (SASE firewall, API gateways etc.) -
      terminate and re-establish TLS.

   *  RDP latest version - terminate and re-establish TLS; tcp/ip.

   *  SCTP session termination (Mobile network SASE firewall etc.) -
      terminate and re-establish TLS; sctp/ip; does not use TCP or UDP.

5.2.  Not Using TLS

   *  SSH tunnel (Jump hosts etc.) - terminate and re-establish ssh;
      tcp/ip; does not use TLS.

   *  IPSEC tunnel (Router control plane etc.) - terminates IPSEC tunnel
      and forwards encapsulated traffic; ip; does not use TLS.

5.3.  Approaches

   *  Enhance applications (e.g. MCP protocol) to convey Workload ID
      (WID), with location field.

   *  Enhance HTTP headers to convey Workload ID (WID), with location
      field.

   *  Enhance TLS to convey Workload ID (WID), with location field.

   *  Enhance SSH/IPSEC to convey Workload ID (WID), with location
      field.

   *Note*: A GPS sensor with a cryptographic signature, also known as
   GNSS signal authentication, uses digital signatures in the broadcast
   signal to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the GPS data,
   protecting against spoofing attacks.

7.  Authorization Policy Implementers

   Policy Implementers use attested a geographic boundary from W to make
   decisions.  Example implementers:

   *  SaaS application.

   *  K8s node agent.

   *  OS process scheduler.

   If the policy implementer is at the SaaS application level, things
   are simpler.  However, if it is pushed down to, say, K8s or OS
   process scheduler or JVM class loader/deserializer, then malware can
   be prevented (similar to code-signed application).
